Genesis 30
When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children she envied her sister She said to Jacob Give me children or I shall die
Jacob s anger was kindled against Rachel and he said Am I in the place of God who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb
Then she said Here is my servant Bilhah go in to her so that she may give birth on my behalf that even I may have children through her
So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife and Jacob went in to her
And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son
Then Rachel said God has judged me and has also heard my voice and given me a son Therefore she called his name Dan
Rachel s servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son
Then Rachel said With mighty wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister and have prevailed So she called his name Naphtali
When Leah saw that she had ceased bearing children she took her servant Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife
Then Leah s servant Zilpah bore Jacob a son
And Leah said Good fortune has come so she called his name Gad
Leah s servant Zilpah bore Jacob a second son
And Leah said Happy am I For women have called me happy So she called his name Asher
In the days of wheat harvest Reuben went and found mandrakes in the field and brought them to his mother Leah Then Rachel said to Leah Please give me some of your son s mandrakes
But she said to her Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband Would you take away my son s mandrakes also Rachel said Then he may lie with you tonight in exchange for your son s mandrakes
When Jacob came from the field in the evening Leah went out to meet him and said You must come in to me for I have hired you with my son s mandrakes So he lay with her that night
And God listened to Leah and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son
Leah said God has given me my wages because I gave my servant to my husband So she called his name Issachar
And Leah conceived again and she bore Jacob a sixth son
Then Leah said God has endowed me with a good endowment now my husband will honor me because I have borne him six sons So she called his name Zebulun
Afterward she bore a daughter and called her name Dinah
Then God remembered Rachel and God listened to her and opened her womb
She conceived and bore a son and said God has taken away my reproach
And she called his name Joseph saying May the LORD add to me another son
As soon as Rachel had borne Joseph Jacob said to Laban Send me away that I may go to my own home and country
Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you that I may go for you know the service that I have given you
But Laban said to him If I have found favor in your sight I have learned by divination that the LORD has blessed me because of you
Name your wages and I will give it
Jacob said to him You yourself know how I have served you and how your livestock has fared with me
For you had little before I came and it has increased abundantly and the LORD has blessed you wherever I turned But now when shall I provide for my own household also
He said What shall I give you Jacob said You shall not give me anything If you will do this for me I will again pasture your flock and keep it
let me pass through all your flock today removing from it every speckled and spotted sheep and every black lamb and the spotted and speckled among the goats and they shall be my wages
So my honesty will answer for me later when you come to look into my wages with you Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the lambs if found with me shall be counted stolen
Laban said Good Let it be as you have said
But that day Laban removed the male goats that were striped and spotted and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted every one that had white on it and every lamb that was black and put them in the charge of his sons
And he set a distance of three days journey between himself and Jacob and Jacob pastured the rest of Laban s flock
Then Jacob took fresh sticks of poplar and almond and plane trees and peeled white streaks in them exposing the white of the sticks
He set the sticks that he had peeled in front of the flocks in the troughs that is the watering places where the flocks came to drink And since they bred when they came to drink
the flocks bred in front of the sticks and so the flocks brought forth striped speckled and spotted
And Jacob separated the lambs and set the faces of the flocks toward the striped and all the black in the flock of Laban He put his own droves apart and did not put them with Laban s flock
Whenever the stronger of the flock were breeding Jacob would lay the sticks in the troughs before the eyes of the flock that they might breed among the sticks
but for the feebler of the flock he would not lay them there So the feebler would be Laban s and the stronger Jacob s
Thus the man increased greatly and had large flocks female servants and male servants and camels and donkeys
