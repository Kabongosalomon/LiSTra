Song of Solomon 4
Behold you are beautiful my love behold you are beautiful Your eyes are doves behind your veil Your hair is like a flock of goats leaping down the slopes of Gilead
Your teeth are like a flock of shorn ewes that have come up from the washing all of which bear twins and not one among them has lost its young
Your lips are like a scarlet thread and your mouth is lovely Your cheeks are like halves of a pomegranate behind your veil
Your neck is like the tower of David built in rows of stone on it hang a thousand shields all of them shields of warriors
Your two breasts are like two fawns twins of a gazelle that graze among the lilies
Until the day breathes and the shadows flee I will go away to the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense
You are altogether beautiful my love there is no flaw in you
Come with me from Lebanon my bride come with me from Lebanon Depart from the peak of Amana from the peak of Senir and Hermon from the dens of lions from the mountains of leopards
You have captivated my heart my sister my bride you have captivated my heart with one glance of your eyes with one jewel of your necklace
How beautiful is your love my sister my bride How much better is your love than wine and the fragrance of your oils than any spice
Your lips drip nectar my bride honey and milk are under your tongue the fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon
A garden locked is my sister my bride a spring locked a fountain sealed
Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates with all choicest fruits henna with nard
nard and saffron calamus and cinnamon with all trees of frankincense myrrh and aloes with all choice spices
a garden fountain a well of living water and flowing streams from Lebanon
Awake O north wind and come O south wind Blow upon my garden let its spices flow SHE Let my beloved come to his garden and eat its choicest fruits
