Revelation 22
Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life bright as crystal flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb
through the middle of the street of the city also on either side of the river the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit yielding its fruit each month The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations
No longer will there be anything accursed but the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it and his servants will worship him
They will see his face and his name will be on their foreheads
And night will be no more They will need no light of lamp or sun for the Lord God will be their light and they will reign forever and ever
And he said to me These words are trustworthy and true And the Lord the God of the spirits of the prophets has sent his angel to show his servants what must soon take place
And behold I am coming soon Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book
I John am the one who heard and saw these things And when I heard and saw them I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed them to me
but he said to me You must not do that I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers the prophets and with those who keep the words of this book Worship God
And he said to me Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book for the time is near
Let the evildoer still do evil and the filthy still be filthy and the righteous still do right and the holy still be holy
Behold I am coming soon bringing my recompense with me to repay everyone for what he has done
I am the Alpha and the Omega the first and the last the beginning and the end
Blessed are those who wash their robes so that they may have the right to the tree of life and that they may enter the city by the gates
Outside are the dogs and sorcerers and the sexually immoral and murderers and idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood
I Jesus have sent my angel to testify to you about these things for the churches I am the root and the descendant of David the bright morning star
The Spirit and the Bride say Come And let the one who hears say Come And let the one who is thirsty come let the one who desires take the water of life without price
I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book if anyone adds to them God will add to him the plagues described in this book
and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city which are described in this book
He who testifies to these things says Surely I am coming soon Amen Come Lord Jesus
The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all Amen
