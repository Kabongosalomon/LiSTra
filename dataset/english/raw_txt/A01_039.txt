Genesis 39
Now Joseph had been brought down to Egypt and Potiphar an officer of Pharaoh the captain of the guard an Egyptian had bought him from the Ishmaelites who had brought him down there
The LORD was with Joseph and he became a successful man and he was in the house of his Egyptian master
His master saw that the LORD was with him and that the LORD caused all that he did to succeed in his hands
So Joseph found favor in his sight and attended him and he made him overseer of his house and put him in charge of all that he had
From the time that he made him overseer in his house and over all that he had the LORD blessed the Egyptian s house for Joseph s sake the blessing of the LORD was on all that he had in house and field
So he left all that he had in Joseph s charge and because of him he had no concern about anything but the food he ate Now Joseph was handsome in form and appearance
And after a time his master s wife cast her eyes on Joseph and said Lie with me
But he refused and said to his master s wife Behold because of me my master has no concern about anything in the house and he has put everything that he has in my charge
He is not greater in this house than I am nor has he kept back anything from me except yourself because you are his wife How then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God
And as she spoke to Joseph day after day he would not listen to her to lie beside her or to be with her
But one day when he went into the house to do his work and none of the men of the house was there in the house
she caught him by his garment saying Lie with me But he left his garment in her hand and fled and got out of the house
And as soon as she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled out of the house
she called to the men of her household and said to them See he has brought among us a Hebrew to laugh at us He came in to me to lie with me and I cried out with a loud voice
And as soon as he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried out he left his garment beside me and fled and got out of the house
Then she laid up his garment by her until his master came home
and she told him the same story saying The Hebrew servant whom you have brought among us came in to me to laugh at me
But as soon as I lifted up my voice and cried he left his garment beside me and fled out of the house
As soon as his master heard the words that his wife spoke to him This is the way your servant treated me his anger was kindled
And Joseph s master took him and put him into the prison the place where the king s prisoners were confined and he was there in prison
But the LORD was with Joseph and showed him steadfast love and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison
And the keeper of the prison put Joseph in charge of all the prisoners who were in the prison Whatever was done there he was the one who did it
The keeper of the prison paid no attention to anything that was in Joseph s charge because the LORD was with him And whatever he did the LORD made it succeed
