Ezekiel 31
In the eleventh year in the third month on the first day of the month the word of the LORD came to me
Son of man say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his multitude Whom are you like in your greatness
Behold Assyria was a cedar in Lebanon with beautiful branches and forest shade and of towering height its top among the clouds
The waters nourished it the deep made it grow tall making its rivers flow around the place of its planting sending forth its streams to all the trees of the field
So it towered high above all the trees of the field its boughs grew large and its branches long from abundant water in its shoots
All the birds of the heavens made their nests in its boughs under its branches all the beasts of the field gave birth to their young and under its shadow lived all great nations
It was beautiful in its greatness in the length of its branches for its roots went down to abundant waters
The cedars in the garden of God could not rival it nor the fir trees equal its boughs neither were the plane trees like its branches no tree in the garden of God was its equal in beauty
I made it beautiful in the mass of its branches and all the trees of Eden envied it that were in the garden of God
Therefore thus says the Lord GOD Because it towered high and set its top among the clouds and its heart was proud of its height
I will give it into the hand of a mighty one of the nations He shall surely deal with it as its wickedness deserves I have cast it out
Foreigners the most ruthless of nations have cut it down and left it On the mountains and in all the valleys its branches have fallen and its boughs have been broken in all the ravines of the land and all the peoples of the earth have gone away from its shadow and left it
On its fallen trunk dwell all the birds of the heavens and on its branches are all the beasts of the field
All this is in order that no trees by the waters may grow to towering height or set their tops among the clouds and that no trees that drink water may reach up to them in height For they are all given over to death to the world below among the children of man with those who go down to the pit
Thus says the Lord GOD On the day the cedar went down to Sheol I caused mourning I closed the deep over it and restrained its rivers and many waters were stopped I clothed Lebanon in gloom for it and all the trees of the field fainted because of it
I made the nations quake at the sound of its fall when I cast it down to Sheol with those who go down to the pit And all the trees of Eden the choice and best of Lebanon all that drink water were comforted in the world below
They also went down to Sheol with it to those who are slain by the sword yes those who were its arm who lived under its shadow among the nations
Whom are you thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden You shall be brought down with the trees of Eden to the world below You shall lie among the uncircumcised with those who are slain by the sword This is Pharaoh and all his multitude declares the Lord GOD
