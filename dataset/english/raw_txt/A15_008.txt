Ezra 8
These are the heads of their fathers houses and this is the genealogy of those who went up with me from Babylonia in the reign of Artaxerxes the king
Of the sons of Phinehas Gershom Of the sons of Ithamar Daniel Of the sons of David Hattush
Of the sons of Shecaniah who was of the sons of Parosh Zechariah with whom were registered men
Of the sons of Pahath moab Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah and with him men
Of the sons of Zattu Shecaniah the son of Jahaziel and with him men
Of the sons of Adin Ebed the son of Jonathan and with him men
Of the sons of Elam Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah and with him men
Of the sons of Shephatiah Zebadiah the son of Michael and with him men
Of the sons of Joab Obadiah the son of Jehiel and with him men
Of the sons of Bani Shelomith the son of Josiphiah and with him men
Of the sons of Bebai Zechariah the son of Bebai and with him men
Of the sons of Azgad Johanan the son of Hakkatan and with him men
Of the sons of Adonikam those who came later their names being Eliphelet Jeuel and Shemaiah and with them men
Of the sons of Bigvai Uthai and Zaccur and with them men
I gathered them to the river that runs to Ahava and there we camped three days As I reviewed the people and the priests I found there none of the sons of Levi
Then I sent for Eliezer Ariel Shemaiah Elnathan Jarib Elnathan Nathan Zechariah and Meshullam leading men and for Joiarib and Elnathan who were men of insight
and sent them to Iddo the leading man at the place Casiphia telling them what to say to Iddo and his brothers and the temple servants at the place Casiphia namely to send us ministers for the house of our God
And by the good hand of our God on us they brought us a man of discretion of the sons of Mahli the son of Levi son of Israel namely Sherebiah with his sons and kinsmen
also Hashabiah and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari with his kinsmen and their sons
besides of the temple servants whom David and his officials had set apart to attend the Levites These were all mentioned by name
Then I proclaimed a fast there at the river Ahava that we might humble ourselves before our God to seek from him a safe journey for ourselves our children and all our goods
For I was ashamed to ask the king for a band of soldiers and horsemen to protect us against the enemy on our way since we had told the king The hand of our God is for good on all who seek him and the power of his wrath is against all who forsake him
So we fasted and implored our God for this and he listened to our entreaty
Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests Sherebiah Hashabiah and ten of their kinsmen with them
And I weighed out to them the silver and the gold and the vessels the offering for the house of our God that the king and his counselors and his lords and all Israel there present had offered
I weighed out into their hand talents of silver and silver vessels worth talents and talents of gold
bowls of gold worth darics and two vessels of fine bright bronze as precious as gold
And I said to them You are holy to the LORD and the vessels are holy and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to the LORD the God of your fathers
Guard them and keep them until you weigh them before the chief priests and the Levites and the heads of fathers houses in Israel at Jerusalem within the chambers of the house of the LORD
So the priests and the Levites took over the weight of the silver and the gold and the vessels to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God
Then we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month to go to Jerusalem The hand of our God was on us and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and from ambushes by the way
We came to Jerusalem and there we remained three days
On the fourth day within the house of our God the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed into the hands of Meremoth the priest son of Uriah and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas and with them were the Levites Jozabad the son of Jeshua and Noadiah the son of Binnui
The whole was counted and weighed and the weight of everything was recorded
At that time those who had come from captivity the returned exiles offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel twelve bulls for all Israel ninety six rams seventy seven lambs and as a sin offering twelve male goats All this was a burnt offering to the LORD
They also delivered the king s commissions to the king s satraps and to the governors of the province Beyond the River and they aided the people and the house of God
