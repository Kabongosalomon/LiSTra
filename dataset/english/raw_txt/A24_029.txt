Jeremiah 29
These are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the surviving elders of the exiles and to the priests the prophets and all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon
This was after King Jeconiah and the queen mother the eunuchs the officials of Judah and Jerusalem the craftsmen and the metal workers had departed from Jerusalem
The letter was sent by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon It said
Thus says the LORD of hosts the God of Israel to all the exiles whom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon
Build houses and live in them plant gardens and eat their produce
Take wives and have sons and daughters take wives for your sons and give your daughters in marriage that they may bear sons and daughters multiply there and do not decrease
But seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile and pray to the LORD on its behalf for in its welfare you will find your welfare
For thus says the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Do not let your prophets and your diviners who are among you deceive you and do not listen to the dreams that they dream
for it is a lie that they are prophesying to you in my name I did not send them declares the LORD
For thus says the LORD When seventy years are completed for Babylon I will visit you and I will fulfill to you my promise and bring you back to this place
For I know the plans I have for you declares the LORD plans for welfare and not for evil to give you a future and a hope
Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me and I will hear you
You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart
I will be found by you declares the LORD and I will restore your fortunes and gather you from all the nations and all the places where I have driven you declares the LORD and I will bring you back to the place from which I sent you into exile
Because you have said The LORD has raised up prophets for us in Babylon
thus says the LORD concerning the king who sits on the throne of David and concerning all the people who dwell in this city your kinsmen who did not go out with you into exile
Thus says the LORD of hosts behold I am sending on them sword famine and pestilence and I will make them like vile figs that are so rotten they cannot be eaten
I will pursue them with sword famine and pestilence and will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth to be a curse a terror a hissing and a reproach among all the nations where I have driven them
because they did not pay attention to my words declares the LORD that I persistently sent to you by my servants the prophets but you would not listen declares the LORD
Hear the word of the LORD all you exiles whom I sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon
Thus says the LORD of hosts the God of Israel concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah who are prophesying a lie to you in my name Behold I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and he shall strike them down before your eyes
Because of them this curse shall be used by all the exiles from Judah in Babylon The LORD make you like Zedekiah and Ahab whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire
because they have done an outrageous thing in Israel they have committed adultery with their neighbors wives and they have spoken in my name lying words that I did not command them I am the one who knows and I am witness declares the LORD
To Shemaiah of Nehelam you shall say
Thus says the LORD of hosts the God of Israel You have sent letters in your name to all the people who are in Jerusalem and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest and to all the priests saying
The LORD has made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest to have charge in the house of the LORD over every madman who prophesies to put him in the stocks and neck irons
Now why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who is prophesying to you
For he has sent to us in Babylon saying Your exile will be long build houses and live in them and plant gardens and eat their produce
Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet
Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah
Send to all the exiles saying Thus says the LORD concerning Shemaiah of Nehelam Because Shemaiah had prophesied to you when I did not send him and has made you trust in a lie
therefore thus says the LORD Behold I will punish Shemaiah of Nehelam and his descendants He shall not have anyone living among this people and he shall not see the good that I will do to my people declares the LORD for he has spoken rebellion against the LORD
