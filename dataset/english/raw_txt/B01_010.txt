Matthew 10
And he called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal every disease and every affliction
The names of the twelve apostles are these first Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother James the son of Zebedee and John his brother
Philip and Bartholomew Thomas and Matthew the tax collector James the son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus
Simon the Cananaean and Judas Iscariot who betrayed him
These twelve Jesus sent out instructing them Go nowhere among the Gentiles and enter no town of the Samaritans
but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel
And proclaim as you go saying The kingdom of heaven is at hand
Heal the sick raise the dead cleanse lepers cast out demons You received without paying give without pay
Acquire no gold nor silver nor copper for your belts
no bag for your journey nor two tunics nor sandals nor a staff for the laborer deserves his food
And whatever town or village you enter find out who is worthy in it and stay there until you depart
As you enter the house greet it
And if the house is worthy let your peace come upon it but if it is not worthy let your peace return to you
And if anyone will not receive you or listen to your words shake off the dust from your feet when you leave that house or town
Truly I say to you it will be more bearable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town
Behold I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves
Beware of men for they will deliver you over to courts and flog you in their synagogues
and you will be dragged before governors and kings for my sake to bear witness before them and the Gentiles
When they deliver you over do not be anxious how you are to speak or what you are to say for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour
For it is not you who speak but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you
Brother will deliver brother over to death and the father his child and children will rise against parents and have them put to death
and you will be hated by all for my name s sake But the one who endures to the end will be saved
When they persecute you in one town flee to the next for truly I say to you you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes
A disciple is not above his teacher nor a servant above his master
It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher and the servant like his master If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul how much more will they malign those of his household
So have no fear of them for nothing is covered that will not be revealed or hidden that will not be known
What I tell you in the dark say in the light and what you hear whispered proclaim on the housetops
And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell
Are not two sparrows sold for a penny And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father
But even the hairs of your head are all numbered
Fear not therefore you are of more value than many sparrows
So everyone who acknowledges me before men I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven
but whoever denies me before men I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven
Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth I have not come to bring peace but a sword
For I have come to set a man against his father and a daughter against her mother and a daughter in law against her mother in law
And a person s enemies will be those of his own household
Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me
And whoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me
Whoever finds his life will lose it and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it
Whoever receives you receives me and whoever receives me receives him who sent me
The one who receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet s reward and the one who receives a righteous person because he is a righteous person will receive a righteous person s reward
And whoever gives one of these little ones even a cup of cold water because he is a disciple truly I say to you he will by no means lose his reward
