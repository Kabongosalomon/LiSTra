Galathians 3
O foolish Galatians Who has bewitched you It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified
Let me ask you only this Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith
Are you so foolish Having begun by the Spirit are you now being perfected by the flesh
Did you suffer so many things in vain if indeed it was in vain
Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law or by hearing with faith
just as Abraham believed God and it was counted to him as righteousness
Know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham
And the Scripture foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham saying In you shall all the nations be blessed
So then those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham the man of faith
For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse for it is written Cursed be everyone who does not abide by all things written in the Book of the Law and do them
Now it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law for The righteous shall live by faith
But the law is not of faith rather The one who does them shall live by them
Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us for it is written Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree
so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles so that we might receive the promised Spirit through faith
To give a human example brothers even with a man made covenant no one annuls it or adds to it once it has been ratified
Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring It does not say And to offsprings referring to many but referring to one And to your offspring who is Christ
This is what I mean the law which came years afterward does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God so as to make the promise void
For if the inheritance comes by the law it no longer comes by promise but God gave it to Abraham by a promise
Why then the law It was added because of transgressions until the offspring should come to whom the promise had been made and it was put in place through angels by an intermediary
Now an intermediary implies more than one but God is one
Is the law then contrary to the promises of God Certainly not For if a law had been given that could give life then righteousness would indeed be by the law
But the Scripture imprisoned everything under sin so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe
Now before faith came we were held captive under the law imprisoned until the coming faith would be revealed
So then the law was our guardian until Christ came in order that we might be justified by faith
But now that faith has come we are no longer under a guardian
for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God through faith
For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ
There is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither slave nor free there is no male and female for you are all one in Christ Jesus
And if you are Christ s then you are Abraham s offspring heirs according to promise
