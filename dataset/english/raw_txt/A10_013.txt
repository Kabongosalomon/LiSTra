2 Samuel 13
Now Absalom David s son had a beautiful sister whose name was Tamar And after a time Amnon David s son loved her
And Amnon was so tormented that he made himself ill because of his sister Tamar for she was a virgin and it seemed impossible to Amnon to do anything to her
But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab the son of Shimeah David s brother And Jonadab was a very crafty man
And he said to him O son of the king why are you so haggard morning after morning Will you not tell me Amnon said to him I love Tamar my brother Absalom s sister
Jonadab said to him Lie down on your bed and pretend to be ill And when your father comes to see you say to him Let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to eat and prepare the food in my sight that I may see it and eat it from her hand
So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill And when the king came to see him Amnon said to the king Please let my sister Tamar come and make a couple of cakes in my sight that I may eat from her hand
Then David sent home to Tamar saying Go to your brother Amnon s house and prepare food for him
So Tamar went to her brother Amnon s house where he was lying down And she took dough and kneaded it and made cakes in his sight and baked the cakes
And she took the pan and emptied it out before him but he refused to eat And Amnon said Send out everyone from me So everyone went out from him
Then Amnon said to Tamar Bring the food into the chamber that I may eat from your hand And Tamar took the cakes she had made and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother
But when she brought them near him to eat he took hold of her and said to her Come lie with me my sister
She answered him No my brother do not violate me for such a thing is not done in Israel do not do this outrageous thing
As for me where could I carry my shame And as for you you would be as one of the outrageous fools in Israel Now therefore please speak to the king for he will not withhold me from you
But he would not listen to her and being stronger than she he violated her and lay with her
Then Amnon hated her with very great hatred so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her And Amnon said to her Get up Go
But she said to him No my brother for this wrong in sending me away is greater than the other that you did to me But he would not listen to her
He called the young man who served him and said Put this woman out of my presence and bolt the door after her
Now she was wearing a long robe with sleeves for thus were the virgin daughters of the king dressed So his servant put her out and bolted the door after her
And Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the long robe that she wore And she laid her hand on her head and went away crying aloud as she went
And her brother Absalom said to her Has Amnon your brother been with you Now hold your peace my sister He is your brother do not take this to heart So Tamar lived a desolate woman in her brother Absalom s house
When King David heard of all these things he was very angry
But Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad for Absalom hated Amnon because he had violated his sister Tamar
After two full years Absalom had sheepshearers at Baal hazor which is near Ephraim and Absalom invited all the king s sons
And Absalom came to the king and said Behold your servant has sheepshearers Please let the king and his servants go with your servant
But the king said to Absalom No my son let us not all go lest we be burdensome to you He pressed him but he would not go but gave him his blessing
Then Absalom said If not please let my brother Amnon go with us And the king said to him Why should he go with you
But Absalom pressed him until he let Amnon and all the king s sons go with him
Then Absalom commanded his servants Mark when Amnon s heart is merry with wine and when I say to you Strike Amnon then kill him Do not fear have I not commanded you Be courageous and be valiant
So the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded Then all the king s sons arose and each mounted his mule and fled
While they were on the way news came to David Absalom has struck down all the king s sons and not one of them is left
Then the king arose and tore his garments and lay on the earth And all his servants who were standing by tore their garments
But Jonadab the son of Shimeah David s brother said Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king s sons for Amnon alone is dead For by the command of Absalom this has been determined from the day he violated his sister Tamar
Now therefore let not my lord the king so take it to heart as to suppose that all the king s sons are dead for Amnon alone is dead
But Absalom fled And the young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes and looked and behold many people were coming from the road behind him by the side of the mountain
And Jonadab said to the king Behold the king s sons have come as your servant said so it has come about
And as soon as he had finished speaking behold the king s sons came and lifted up their voice and wept And the king also and all his servants wept very bitterly
But Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud king of Geshur And David mourned for his son day after day
So Absalom fled and went to Geshur and was there three years
And the spirit of the king longed to go out to Absalom because he was comforted about Amnon since he was dead
