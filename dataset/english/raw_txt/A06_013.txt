Joshua 13
Now Joshua was old and advanced in years and the LORD said to him You are old and advanced in years and there remains yet very much land to possess
This is the land that yet remains all the regions of the Philistines and all those of the Geshurites
from the Shihor which is east of Egypt northward to the boundary of Ekron it is counted as Canaanite there are five rulers of the Philistines those of Gaza Ashdod Ashkelon Gath and Ekron and those of the Avvim
in the south all the land of the Canaanites and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians to Aphek to the boundary of the Amorites
and the land of the Gebalites and all Lebanon toward the sunrise from Baal gad below Mount Hermon to Lebo hamath
all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth maim even all the Sidonians I myself will drive them out from before the people of Israel Only allot the land to Israel for an inheritance as I have commanded you
Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes and half the tribe of Manasseh
With the other half of the tribe of Manasseh the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance which Moses gave them beyond the Jordan eastward as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them
from Aroer which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon and the city that is in the middle of the valley and all the tableland of Medeba as far as Dibon
and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites who reigned in Heshbon as far as the boundary of the Ammonites
and Gilead and the region of the Geshurites and Maacathites and all Mount Hermon and all Bashan to Salecah
all the kingdom of Og in Bashan who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei he alone was left of the remnant of the Rephaim these Moses had struck and driven out
Yet the people of Israel did not drive out the Geshurites or the Maacathites but Geshur and Maacath dwell in the midst of Israel to this day
To the tribe of Levi alone Moses gave no inheritance The offerings by fire to the LORD God of Israel are their inheritance as he said to him
And Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of the people of Reuben according to their clans
So their territory was from Aroer which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon and the city that is in the middle of the valley and all the tableland by Medeba
with Heshbon and all its cities that are in the tableland Dibon and Bamoth baal and Beth baal meon
and Jahaz and Kedemoth and Mephaath
and Kiriathaim and Sibmah and Zereth shahar on the hill of the valley
and Beth peor and the slopes of Pisgah and Beth jeshimoth
that is all the cities of the tableland and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites who reigned in Heshbon whom Moses defeated with the leaders of Midian Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba the princes of Sihon who lived in the land
Balaam also the son of Beor the one who practiced divination was killed with the sword by the people of Israel among the rest of their slain
And the border of the people of Reuben was the Jordan as a boundary This was the inheritance of the people of Reuben according to their clans with their cities and villages
Moses gave an inheritance also to the tribe of Gad to the people of Gad according to their clans
Their territory was Jazer and all the cities of Gilead and half the land of the Ammonites to Aroer which is east of Rabbah
and from Heshbon to Ramath mizpeh and Betonim and from Mahanaim to the territory of Debir
and in the valley Beth haram Beth nimrah Succoth and Zaphon the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon having the Jordan as a boundary to the lower end of the Sea of Chinnereth eastward beyond the Jordan
This is the inheritance of the people of Gad according to their clans with their cities and villages
And Moses gave an inheritance to the half tribe of Manasseh It was allotted to the half tribe of the people of Manasseh according to their clans
Their region extended from Mahanaim through all Bashan the whole kingdom of Og king of Bashan and all the towns of Jair which are in Bashan sixty cities
and half Gilead and Ashtaroth and Edrei the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan These were allotted to the people of Machir the son of Manasseh for the half of the people of Machir according to their clans
These are the inheritances that Moses distributed in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan east of Jericho
But to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance the LORD God of Israel is their inheritance just as he said to them
