Jeremiah 18
The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD
Arise and go down to the potter s house and there I will let you hear my words
So I went down to the potter s house and there he was working at his wheel
And the vessel he was making of clay was spoiled in the potter s hand and he reworked it into another vessel as it seemed good to the potter to do
Then the word of the LORD came to me
O house of Israel can I not do with you as this potter has done declares the LORD Behold like the clay in the potter s hand so are you in my hand O house of Israel
If at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom that I will pluck up and break down and destroy it
and if that nation concerning which I have spoken turns from its evil I will relent of the disaster that I intended to do to it
And if at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom that I will build and plant it
and if it does evil in my sight not listening to my voice then I will relent of the good that I had intended to do to it
Now therefore say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem Thus says the LORD Behold I am shaping disaster against you and devising a plan against you Return every one from his evil way and amend your ways and your deeds
But they say That is in vain We will follow our own plans and will every one act according to the stubbornness of his evil heart
Therefore thus says the LORD Ask among the nations Who has heard the like of this The virgin Israel has done a very horrible thing
Does the snow of Lebanon leave the crags of Sirion Do the mountain waters run dry the cold flowing streams
But my people have forgotten me they make offerings to false gods they made them stumble in their ways in the ancient roads and to walk into side roads not the highway
making their land a horror a thing to be hissed at forever Everyone who passes by it is horrified and shakes his head
Like the east wind I will scatter them before the enemy I will show them my back not my face in the day of their calamity
Then they said Come let us make plots against Jeremiah for the law shall not perish from the priest nor counsel from the wise nor the word from the prophet Come let us strike him with the tongue and let us not pay attention to any of his words
Hear me O LORD and listen to the voice of my adversaries
Should good be repaid with evil Yet they have dug a pit for my life Remember how I stood before you to speak good for them to turn away your wrath from them
Therefore deliver up their children to famine give them over to the power of the sword let their wives become childless and widowed May their men meet death by pestilence their youths be struck down by the sword in battle
May a cry be heard from their houses when you bring the plunderer suddenly upon them For they have dug a pit to take me and laid snares for my feet
Yet you O LORD know all their plotting to kill me Forgive not their iniquity nor blot out their sin from your sight Let them be overthrown before you deal with them in the time of your anger
