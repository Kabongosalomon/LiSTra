According to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua he gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh a portion among the people of Judah Kiriath arba that is Hebron Arba was the father of Anak
And Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anak Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai the descendants of Anak
And he went up from there against the inhabitants of Debir Now the name of Debir formerly was Kiriath sepher
And Caleb said Whoever strikes Kiriath sepher and captures it to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife
And Othniel the son of Kenaz the brother of Caleb captured it And he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife
When she came to him she urged him to ask her father for a field And she got off her donkey and Caleb said to her What do you want
She said to him Give me a blessing Since you have given me the land of the Negeb give me also springs of water And he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs
