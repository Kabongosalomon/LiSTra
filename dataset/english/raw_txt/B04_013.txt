John 13
Now before the Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart out of this world to the Father having loved his own who were in the world he loved them to the end
During supper when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot Simon s son to betray him
Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands and that he had come from God and was going back to God
rose from supper He laid aside his outer garments and taking a towel tied it around his waist
Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him
He came to Simon Peter who said to him Lord do you wash my feet
Jesus answered him What I am doing you do not understand now but afterward you will understand
Peter said to him You shall never wash my feet Jesus answered him If I do not wash you you have no share with me
Simon Peter said to him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head
Jesus said to him The one who has bathed does not need to wash except for his feet but is completely clean And you are clean but not every one of you
For he knew who was to betray him that was why he said Not all of you are clean
When he had washed their feet and put on his outer garments and resumed his place he said to them Do you understand what I have done to you
You call me Teacher and Lord and you are right for so I am
If I then your Lord and Teacher have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another s feet
For I have given you an example that you also should do just as I have done to you
Truly truly I say to you a servant is not greater than his master nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him
If you know these things blessed are you if you do them
I am not speaking of all of you I know whom I have chosen But the Scripture will be fulfilled He who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me
I am telling you this now before it takes place that when it does take place you may believe that I am he
Truly truly I say to you whoever receives the one I send receives me and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me
After saying these things Jesus was troubled in his spirit and testified Truly truly I say to you one of you will betray me
The disciples looked at one another uncertain of whom he spoke
One of his disciples whom Jesus loved was reclining at table close to Jesus
so Simon Peter motioned to him to ask Jesus of whom he was speaking
So that disciple leaning back against Jesus said to him Lord who is it
Jesus answered It is he to whom I will give this morsel of bread when I have dipped it So when he had dipped the morsel he gave it to Judas the son of Simon Iscariot
Then after he had taken the morsel Satan entered into him Jesus said to him What you are going to do do quickly
Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him
Some thought that because Judas had the moneybag Jesus was telling him Buy what we need for the feast or that he should give something to the poor
So after receiving the morsel of bread he immediately went out And it was night
When he had gone out Jesus said Now is the Son of Man glorified and God is glorified in him
If God is glorified in him God will also glorify him in himself and glorify him at once
Little children yet a little while I am with you You will seek me and just as I said to the Jews so now I also say to you Where I am going you cannot come
A new commandment I give to you that you love one another just as I have loved you you also are to love one another
By this all people will know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another
Simon Peter said to him Lord where are you going Jesus answered him Where I am going you cannot follow me now but you will follow afterward
Peter said to him Lord why can I not follow you now I will lay down my life for you
Jesus answered Will you lay down your life for me Truly truly I say to you the rooster will not crow till you have denied me three times
