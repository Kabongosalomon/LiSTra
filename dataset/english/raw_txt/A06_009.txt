Joshua 9
As soon as all the kings who were beyond the Jordan in the hill country and in the lowland all along the coast of the Great Sea toward Lebanon the Hittites the Amorites the Canaanites the Perizzites the Hivites and the Jebusites heard of this
they gathered together as one to fight against Joshua and Israel
But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai
they on their part acted with cunning and went and made ready provisions and took worn out sacks for their donkeys and wineskins worn out and torn and mended
with worn out patched sandals on their feet and worn out clothes And all their provisions were dry and crumbly
And they went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and to the men of Israel We have come from a distant country so now make a covenant with us
But the men of Israel said to the Hivites Perhaps you live among us then how can we make a covenant with you
They said to Joshua We are your servants And Joshua said to them Who are you And where do you come from
They said to him From a very distant country your servants have come because of the name of the LORD your God For we have heard a report of him and all that he did in Egypt
and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan to Sihon the king of Heshbon and to Og king of Bashan who lived in Ashtaroth
So our elders and all the inhabitants of our country said to us Take provisions in your hand for the journey and go to meet them and say to them We are your servants Come now make a covenant with us
Here is our bread It was still warm when we took it from our houses as our food for the journey on the day we set out to come to you but now behold it is dry and crumbly
These wineskins were new when we filled them and behold they have burst And these garments and sandals of ours are worn out from the very long journey
So the men took some of their provisions but did not ask counsel from the LORD
And Joshua made peace with them and made a covenant with them to let them live and the leaders of the congregation swore to them
At the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them they heard that they were their neighbors and that they lived among them
And the people of Israel set out and reached their cities on the third day Now their cities were Gibeon Chephirah Beeroth and Kiriath jearim
But the people of Israel did not attack them because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by the LORD the God of Israel Then all the congregation murmured against the leaders
But all the leaders said to all the congregation We have sworn to them by the LORD the God of Israel and now we may not touch them
This we will do to them let them live lest wrath be upon us because of the oath that we swore to them
And the leaders said to them Let them live So they became cutters of wood and drawers of water for all the congregation just as the leaders had said of them
Joshua summoned them and he said to them Why did you deceive us saying We are very far from you when you dwell among us
Now therefore you are cursed and some of you shall never be anything but servants cutters of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God
They answered Joshua Because it was told to your servants for a certainty that the LORD your God had commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you so we feared greatly for our lives because of you and did this thing
And now behold we are in your hand Whatever seems good and right in your sight to do to us do it
So he did this to them and delivered them out of the hand of the people of Israel and they did not kill them
But Joshua made them that day cutters of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the LORD to this day in the place that he should choose
