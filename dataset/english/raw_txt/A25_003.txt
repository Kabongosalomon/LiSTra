Lamentations 3
I am the man who has seen affliction under the rod of his wrath
he has driven and brought me into darkness without any light
surely against me he turns his hand again and again the whole day long
He has made my flesh and my skin waste away he has broken my bones
he has besieged and enveloped me with bitterness and tribulation
he has made me dwell in darkness like the dead of long ago
He has walled me about so that I cannot escape he has made my chains heavy
though I call and cry for help he shuts out my prayer
he has blocked my ways with blocks of stones he has made my paths crooked
He is a bear lying in wait for me a lion in hiding
he turned aside my steps and tore me to pieces he has made me desolate
he bent his bow and set me as a target for his arrow
He drove into my kidneys the arrows of his quiver
I have become the laughingstock of all peoples the object of their taunts all day long
He has filled me with bitterness he has sated me with wormwood
He has made my teeth grind on gravel and made me cower in ashes
my soul is bereft of peace I have forgotten what happiness is
so I say My endurance has perished so has my hope from the LORD
Remember my affliction and my wanderings the wormwood and the gall
My soul continually remembers it and is bowed down within me
But this I call to mind and therefore I have hope
The steadfast love of the LORD never ceases his mercies never come to an end
they are new every morning great is your faithfulness
The LORD is my portion says my soul therefore I will hope in him
The LORD is good to those who wait for him to the soul who seeks him
It is good that one should wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD
It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth
Let him sit alone in silence when it is laid on him
let him put his mouth in the dust there may yet be hope
let him give his cheek to the one who strikes and let him be filled with insults
For the Lord will not cast off forever
but though he cause grief he will have compassion according to the abundance of his steadfast love
for he does not willingly afflict or grieve the children of men
To crush underfoot all the prisoners of the earth
to deny a man justice in the presence of the Most High
to subvert a man in his lawsuit the Lord does not approve
Who has spoken and it came to pass unless the Lord has commanded it
Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that good and bad come
Why should a living man complain a man about the punishment of his sins
Let us test and examine our ways and return to the LORD
Let us lift up our hearts and hands to God in heaven
We have transgressed and rebelled and you have not forgiven
You have wrapped yourself with anger and pursued us killing without pity
you have wrapped yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can pass through
You have made us scum and garbage among the peoples
All our enemies open their mouths against us
panic and pitfall have come upon us devastation and destruction
my eyes flow with rivers of tears because of the destruction of the daughter of my people
My eyes will flow without ceasing without respite
until the LORD from heaven looks down and sees
my eyes cause me grief at the fate of all the daughters of my city
I have been hunted like a bird by those who were my enemies without cause
they flung me alive into the pit and cast stones on me
water closed over my head I said I am lost
I called on your name O LORD from the depths of the pit
you heard my plea Do not close your ear to my cry for help
You came near when I called on you you said Do not fear
You have taken up my cause O Lord you have redeemed my life
You have seen the wrong done to me O LORD judge my cause
You have seen all their vengeance all their plots against me
You have heard their taunts O LORD all their plots against me
The lips and thoughts of my assailants are against me all the day long
Behold their sitting and their rising I am the object of their taunts
You will repay them O LORD according to the work of their hands
You will give them dullness of heart your curse will be on them
You will pursue them in anger and destroy them from under your heavens O LORD
