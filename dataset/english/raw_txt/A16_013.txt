Nehemiah 13
On that day they read from the Book of Moses in the hearing of the people And in it was found written that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever enter the assembly of God
for they did not meet the people of Israel with bread and water but hired Balaam against them to curse them yet our God turned the curse into a blessing
As soon as the people heard the law they separated from Israel all those of foreign descent
Now before this Eliashib the priest who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God and who was related to Tobiah
prepared for Tobiah a large chamber where they had previously put the grain offering the frankincense the vessels and the tithes of grain wine and oil which were given by commandment to the Levites singers and gatekeepers and the contributions for the priests
While this was taking place I was not in Jerusalem for in the thirty second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went to the king And after some time I asked leave of the king
and came to Jerusalem and I then discovered the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah preparing for him a chamber in the courts of the house of God
And I was very angry and I threw all the household furniture of Tobiah out of the chamber
Then I gave orders and they cleansed the chambers and I brought back there the vessels of the house of God with the grain offering and the frankincense
I also found out that the portions of the Levites had not been given to them so that the Levites and the singers who did the work had fled each to his field
So I confronted the officials and said Why is the house of God forsaken And I gathered them together and set them in their stations
Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain wine and oil into the storehouses
And I appointed as treasurers over the storehouses Shelemiah the priest Zadok the scribe and Pedaiah of the Levites and as their assistant Hanan the son of Zaccur son of Mattaniah for they were considered reliable and their duty was to distribute to their brothers
Remember me O my God concerning this and do not wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God and for his service
In those days I saw in Judah people treading winepresses on the Sabbath and bringing in heaps of grain and loading them on donkeys and also wine grapes figs and all kinds of loads which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day And I warned them on the day when they sold food
Tyrians also who lived in the city brought in fish and all kinds of goods and sold them on the Sabbath to the people of Judah in Jerusalem itself
Then I confronted the nobles of Judah and said to them What is this evil thing that you are doing profaning the Sabbath day
Did not your fathers act in this way and did not our God bring all this disaster on us and on this city Now you are bringing more wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath
As soon as it began to grow dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath I commanded that the doors should be shut and gave orders that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath And I stationed some of my servants at the gates that no load might be brought in on the Sabbath day
Then the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice
But I warned them and said to them Why do you lodge outside the wall If you do so again I will lay hands on you From that time on they did not come on the Sabbath
Then I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves and come and guard the gates to keep the Sabbath day holy Remember this also in my favor O my God and spare me according to the greatness of your steadfast love
In those days also I saw the Jews who had married women of Ashdod Ammon and Moab
And half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod and they could not speak the language of Judah but only the language of each people
And I confronted them and cursed them and beat some of them and pulled out their hair And I made them take oath in the name of God saying You shall not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves
Did not Solomon king of Israel sin on account of such women Among the many nations there was no king like him and he was beloved by his God and God made him king over all Israel Nevertheless foreign women made even him to sin
Shall we then listen to you and do all this great evil and act treacherously against our God by marrying foreign women
And one of the sons of Jehoiada the son of Eliashib the high priest was the son in law of Sanballat the Horonite Therefore I chased him from me
Remember them O my God because they have desecrated the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites
Thus I cleansed them from everything foreign and I established the duties of the priests and Levites each in his work
and I provided for the wood offering at appointed times and for the firstfruits Remember me O my God for good
