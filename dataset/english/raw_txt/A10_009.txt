2 Samuel 9
And David said Is there still anyone left of the house of Saul that I may show him kindness for Jonathan s sake
Now there was a servant of the house of Saul whose name was Ziba and they called him to David And the king said to him Are you Ziba And he said I am your servant
And the king said Is there not still someone of the house of Saul that I may show the kindness of God to him Ziba said to the king There is still a son of Jonathan he is crippled in his feet
The king said to him Where is he And Ziba said to the king He is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel at Lo debar
Then King David sent and brought him from the house of Machir the son of Ammiel at Lo debar
And Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan son of Saul came to David and fell on his face and paid homage And David said Mephibosheth And he answered Behold I am your servant
And David said to him Do not fear for I will show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan and I will restore to you all the land of Saul your father and you shall eat at my table always
And he paid homage and said What is your servant that you should show regard for a dead dog such as I
Then the king called Ziba Saul s servant and said to him All that belonged to Saul and to all his house I have given to your master s grandson
And you and your sons and your servants shall till the land for him and shall bring in the produce that your master s grandson may have bread to eat But Mephibosheth your master s grandson shall always eat at my table Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants
Then Ziba said to the king According to all that my lord the king commands his servant so will your servant do So Mephibosheth ate at David s table like one of the king s sons
And Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Mica And all who lived in Ziba s house became Mephibosheth s servants
So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem for he ate always at the king s table Now he was lame in both his feet
