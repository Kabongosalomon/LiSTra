Jeremiah 13
Thus says the LORD to me Go and buy a linen loincloth and put it around your waist and do not dip it in water
So I bought a loincloth according to the word of the LORD and put it around my waist
And the word of the LORD came to me a second time
Take the loincloth that you have bought which is around your waist and arise go to the Euphrates and hide it there in a cleft of the rock
So I went and hid it by the Euphrates as the LORD commanded me
And after many days the LORD said to me Arise go to the Euphrates and take from there the loincloth that I commanded you to hide there
Then I went to the Euphrates and dug and I took the loincloth from the place where I had hidden it And behold the loincloth was spoiled it was good for nothing
Then the word of the LORD came to me
Thus says the LORD Even so will I spoil the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem
This evil people who refuse to hear my words who stubbornly follow their own heart and have gone after other gods to serve them and worship them shall be like this loincloth which is good for nothing
For as the loincloth clings to the waist of a man so I made the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah cling to me declares the LORD that they might be for me a people a name a praise and a glory but they would not listen
You shall speak to them this word Thus says the LORD the God of Israel Every jar shall be filled with wine And they will say to you Do we not indeed know that every jar will be filled with wine
Then you shall say to them Thus says the LORD Behold I will fill with drunkenness all the inhabitants of this land the kings who sit on David s throne the priests the prophets and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem
And I will dash them one against another fathers and sons together declares the LORD I will not pity or spare or have compassion that I should not destroy them
Hear and give ear be not proud for the LORD has spoken
Give glory to the LORD your God before he brings darkness before your feet stumble on the twilight mountains and while you look for light he turns it into gloom and makes it deep darkness
But if you will not listen my soul will weep in secret for your pride my eyes will weep bitterly and run down with tears because the LORD s flock has been taken captive
Say to the king and the queen mother Take a lowly seat for your beautiful crown has come down from your head
The cities of the Negeb are shut up with none to open them all Judah is taken into exile wholly taken into exile
Lift up your eyes and see those who come from the north Where is the flock that was given you your beautiful flock
What will you say when they set as head over you those whom you yourself have taught to be friends to you Will not pangs take hold of you like those of a woman in labor
And if you say in your heart Why have these things come upon me it is for the greatness of your iniquity that your skirts are lifted up and you suffer violence
Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots Then also you can do good who are accustomed to do evil
I will scatter you like chaff driven by the wind from the desert
This is your lot the portion I have measured out to you declares the LORD because you have forgotten me and trusted in lies
I myself will lift up your skirts over your face and your shame will be seen
I have seen your abominations your adulteries and neighings your lewd whorings on the hills in the field Woe to you O Jerusalem How long will it be before you are made clean
