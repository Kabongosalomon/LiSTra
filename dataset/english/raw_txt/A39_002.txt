Malachi 2
And now O priests this command is for you
If you will not listen if you will not take it to heart to give honor to my name says the LORD of hosts then I will send the curse upon you and I will curse your blessings Indeed I have already cursed them because you do not lay it to heart
Behold I will rebuke your offspring and spread dung on your faces the dung of your offerings and you shall be taken away with it
So shall you know that I have sent this command to you that my covenant with Levi may stand says the LORD of hosts
My covenant with him was one of life and peace and I gave them to him It was a covenant of fear and he feared me He stood in awe of my name
True instruction was in his mouth and no wrong was found on his lips He walked with me in peace and uprightness and he turned many from iniquity
For the lips of a priest should guard knowledge and people should seek instruction from his mouth for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts
But you have turned aside from the way You have caused many to stumble by your instruction You have corrupted the covenant of Levi says the LORD of hosts
and so I make you despised and abased before all the people inasmuch as you do not keep my ways but show partiality in your instruction
Have we not all one Father Has not one God created us Why then are we faithless to one another profaning the covenant of our fathers
Judah has been faithless and abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem For Judah has profaned the sanctuary of the LORD which he loves and has married the daughter of a foreign god
May the LORD cut off from the tents of Jacob any descendant of the man who does this who brings an offering to the LORD of hosts
And this second thing you do You cover the LORD s altar with tears with weeping and groaning because he no longer regards the offering or accepts it with favor from your hand
But you say Why does he not Because the LORD was witness between you and the wife of your youth to whom you have been faithless though she is your companion and your wife by covenant
Did he not make them one with a portion of the Spirit in their union And what was the one God seeking Godly offspring So guard yourselves in your spirit and let none of you be faithless to the wife of your youth
For the man who does not love his wife but divorces her says the LORD the God of Israel covers his garment with violence says the LORD of hosts So guard yourselves in your spirit and do not be faithless
You have wearied the LORD with your words But you say How have we wearied him By saying Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the LORD and he delights in them Or by asking Where is the God of justice
