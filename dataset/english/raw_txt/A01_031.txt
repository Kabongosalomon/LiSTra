Genesis 31
Now Jacob heard that the sons of Laban were saying Jacob has taken all that was our father s and from what was our father s he has gained all this wealth
And Jacob saw that Laban did not regard him with favor as before
Then the LORD said to Jacob Return to the land of your fathers and to your kindred and I will be with you
So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah into the field where his flock was
and said to them I see that your father does not regard me with favor as he did before But the God of my father has been with me
You know that I have served your father with all my strength
yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times But God did not permit him to harm me
If he said The spotted shall be your wages then all the flock bore spotted and if he said The striped shall be your wages then all the flock bore striped
Thus God has taken away the livestock of your father and given them to me
In the breeding season of the flock I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream that the goats that mated with the flock were striped spotted and mottled
Then the angel of God said to me in the dream Jacob and I said Here I am
And he said Lift up your eyes and see all the goats that mate with the flock are striped spotted and mottled for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you
I am the God of Bethel where you anointed a pillar and made a vow to me Now arise go out from this land and return to the land of your kindred
Then Rachel and Leah answered and said to him Is there any portion or inheritance left to us in our father s house
Are we not regarded by him as foreigners For he has sold us and he has indeed devoured our money
All the wealth that God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our children Now then whatever God has said to you do
So Jacob arose and set his sons and his wives on camels
He drove away all his livestock all his property that he had gained the livestock in his possession that he had acquired in Paddan aram to go to the land of Canaan to his father Isaac
Laban had gone to shear his sheep and Rachel stole her father s household gods
And Jacob tricked Laban the Aramean by not telling him that he intended to flee
He fled with all that he had and arose and crossed the Euphrates and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead
When it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled
he took his kinsmen with him and pursued him for seven days and followed close after him into the hill country of Gilead
But God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream by night and said to him Be careful not to say anything to Jacob either good or bad
And Laban overtook Jacob Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country and Laban with his kinsmen pitched tents in the hill country of Gilead
And Laban said to Jacob What have you done that you have tricked me and driven away my daughters like captives of the sword
Why did you flee secretly and trick me and did not tell me so that I might have sent you away with mirth and songs with tambourine and lyre
And why did you not permit me to kiss my sons and my daughters farewell Now you have done foolishly
It is in my power to do you harm But the God of your father spoke to me last night saying Be careful not to say anything to Jacob either good or bad
And now you have gone away because you longed greatly for your father s house but why did you steal my gods
Jacob answered and said to Laban Because I was afraid for I thought that you would take your daughters from me by force
Anyone with whom you find your gods shall not live In the presence of our kinsmen point out what I have that is yours and take it Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them
So Laban went into Jacob s tent and into Leah s tent and into the tent of the two female servants but he did not find them And he went out of Leah s tent and entered Rachel s
Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them in the camel s saddle and sat on them Laban felt all about the tent but did not find them
And she said to her father Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise before you for the way of women is upon me So he searched but did not find the household gods
Then Jacob became angry and berated Laban Jacob said to Laban What is my offense What is my sin that you have hotly pursued me
For you have felt through all my goods what have you found of all your household goods Set it here before my kinsmen and your kinsmen that they may decide between us two
These twenty years I have been with you Your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried and I have not eaten the rams of your flocks
What was torn by wild beasts I did not bring to you I bore the loss of it myself From my hand you required it whether stolen by day or stolen by night
There I was by day the heat consumed me and the cold by night and my sleep fled from my eyes
These twenty years I have been in your house I served you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flock and you have changed my wages ten times
If the God of my father the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac had not been on my side surely now you would have sent me away empty handed God saw my affliction and the labor of my hands and rebuked you last night
Then Laban answered and said to Jacob The daughters are my daughters the children are my children the flocks are my flocks and all that you see is mine But what can I do this day for these my daughters or for their children whom they have borne
Come now let us make a covenant you and I And let it be a witness between you and me
So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar
And Jacob said to his kinsmen Gather stones And they took stones and made a heap and they ate there by the heap
Laban called it Jegar sahadutha but Jacob called it Galeed
Laban said This heap is a witness between you and me today Therefore he named it Galeed
and Mizpah for he said The LORD watch between you and me when we are out of one another s sight
If you oppress my daughters or if you take wives besides my daughters although no one is with us see God is witness between you and me
Then Laban said to Jacob See this heap and the pillar which I have set between you and me
This heap is a witness and the pillar is a witness that I will not pass over this heap to you and you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me to do harm
The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor the God of their father judge between us So Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac
and Jacob offered a sacrifice in the hill country and called his kinsmen to eat bread They ate bread and spent the night in the hill country
Early in the morning Laban arose and kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them Then Laban departed and returned home
