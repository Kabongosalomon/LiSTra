Deuteronomy 14
You are the sons of the LORD your God You shall not cut yourselves or make any baldness on your foreheads for the dead
For you are a people holy to the LORD your God and the LORD has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth
You shall not eat any abomination
These are the animals you may eat the ox the sheep the goat
the deer the gazelle the roebuck the wild goat the ibex the antelope and the mountain sheep
Every animal that parts the hoof and has the hoof cloven in two and chews the cud among the animals you may eat
Yet of those that chew the cud or have the hoof cloven you shall not eat these the camel the hare and the rock badger because they chew the cud but do not part the hoof are unclean for you
And the pig because it parts the hoof but does not chew the cud is unclean for you Their flesh you shall not eat and their carcasses you shall not touch
Of all that are in the waters you may eat these whatever has fins and scales you may eat
And whatever does not have fins and scales you shall not eat it is unclean for you
You may eat all clean birds
But these are the ones that you shall not eat the eagle the bearded vulture the black vulture
the kite the falcon of any kind
every raven of any kind
the ostrich the nighthawk the sea gull the hawk of any kind
the little owl and the short eared owl the barn owl
and the tawny owl the carrion vulture and the cormorant
the stork the heron of any kind the hoopoe and the bat
And all winged insects are unclean for you they shall not be eaten
All clean winged things you may eat
You shall not eat anything that has died naturally You may give it to the sojourner who is within your towns that he may eat it or you may sell it to a foreigner For you are a people holy to the LORD your God You shall not boil a young goat in its mother s milk
You shall tithe all the yield of your seed that comes from the field year by year
And before the LORD your God in the place that he will choose to make his name dwell there you shall eat the tithe of your grain of your wine and of your oil and the firstborn of your herd and flock that you may learn to fear the LORD your God always
And if the way is too long for you so that you are not able to carry the tithe when the LORD your God blesses you because the place is too far from you which the LORD your God chooses to set his name there
then you shall turn it into money and bind up the money in your hand and go to the place that the LORD your God chooses
and spend the money for whatever you desire oxen or sheep or wine or strong drink whatever your appetite craves And you shall eat there before the LORD your God and rejoice you and your household
And you shall not neglect the Levite who is within your towns for he has no portion or inheritance with you
At the end of every three years you shall bring out all the tithe of your produce in the same year and lay it up within your towns
And the Levite because he has no portion or inheritance with you and the sojourner the fatherless and the widow who are within your towns shall come and eat and be filled that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hands that you do
