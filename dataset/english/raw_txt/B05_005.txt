Acts 5
But a man named Ananias with his wife Sapphira sold a piece of property
and with his wife s knowledge he kept back for himself some of the proceeds and brought only a part of it and laid it at the apostles feet
But Peter said Ananias why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back for yourself part of the proceeds of the land
While it remained unsold did it not remain your own And after it was sold was it not at your disposal Why is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart You have not lied to men but to God
When Ananias heard these words he fell down and breathed his last And great fear came upon all who heard of it
The young men rose and wrapped him up and carried him out and buried him
After an interval of about three hours his wife came in not knowing what had happened
And Peter said to her Tell me whether you sold the land for so much And she said Yes for so much
But Peter said to her How is it that you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord Behold the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door and they will carry you out
Immediately she fell down at his feet and breathed her last When the young men came in they found her dead and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband
And great fear came upon the whole church and upon all who heard of these things
Now many signs and wonders were regularly done among the people by the hands of the apostles And they were all together in Solomon s Portico
None of the rest dared join them but the people held them in high esteem
And more than ever believers were added to the Lord multitudes of both men and women
so that they even carried out the sick into the streets and laid them on cots and mats that as Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on some of them
The people also gathered from the towns around Jerusalem bringing the sick and those afflicted with unclean spirits and they were all healed
But the high priest rose up and all who were with him that is the party of the Sadducees and filled with jealousy
they arrested the apostles and put them in the public prison
But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out and said
Go and stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this Life
And when they heard this they entered the temple at daybreak and began to teach Now when the high priest came and those who were with him they called together the council and all the senate of the people of Israel and sent to the prison to have them brought
But when the officers came they did not find them in the prison so they returned and reported
We found the prison securely locked and the guards standing at the doors but when we opened them we found no one inside
Now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words they were greatly perplexed about them wondering what this would come to
And someone came and told them Look The men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people
Then the captain with the officers went and brought them but not by force for they were afraid of being stoned by the people
And when they had brought them they set them before the council And the high priest questioned them
saying We strictly charged you not to teach in this name yet here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and you intend to bring this man s blood upon us
But Peter and the apostles answered We must obey God rather than men
The God of our fathers raised Jesus whom you killed by hanging him on a tree
God exalted him at his right hand as Leader and Savior to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins
And we are witnesses to these things and so is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him
When they heard this they were enraged and wanted to kill them
But a Pharisee in the council named Gamaliel a teacher of the law held in honor by all the people stood up and gave orders to put the men outside for a little while
And he said to them Men of Israel take care what you are about to do with these men
For before these days Theudas rose up claiming to be somebody and a number of men about four hundred joined him He was killed and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing
After him Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the census and drew away some of the people after him He too perished and all who followed him were scattered
So in the present case I tell you keep away from these men and let them alone for if this plan or this undertaking is of man it will fail
but if it is of God you will not be able to overthrow them You might even be found opposing God So they took his advice
and when they had called in the apostles they beat them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus and let them go
Then they left the presence of the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name
And every day in the temple and from house to house they did not cease teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ
