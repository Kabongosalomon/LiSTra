1 Timothy 1
Paul an apostle of Christ Jesus by command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope
To Timothy my true child in the faith Grace mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord
As I urged you when I was going to Macedonia remain at Ephesus so that you may charge certain persons not to teach any different doctrine
nor to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies which promote speculations rather than the stewardship from God that is by faith
The aim of our charge is love that issues from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith
Certain persons by swerving from these have wandered away into vain discussion
desiring to be teachers of the law without understanding either what they are saying or the things about which they make confident assertions
Now we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully
understanding this that the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient for the ungodly and sinners for the unholy and profane for those who strike their fathers and mothers for murderers
the sexually immoral men who practice homosexuality enslavers liars perjurers and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine
in accordance with the gospel of the glory of the blessed God with which I have been entrusted
I thank him who has given me strength Christ Jesus our Lord because he judged me faithful appointing me to his service
though formerly I was a blasphemer persecutor and insolent opponent But I received mercy because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief
and the grace of our Lord overflowed for me with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus
The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom I am the foremost
But I received mercy for this reason that in me as the foremost Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience as an example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life
To the King of ages immortal invisible the only God be honor and glory forever and ever Amen
This charge I entrust to you Timothy my child in accordance with the prophecies previously made about you that by them you may wage the good warfare
holding faith and a good conscience By rejecting this some have made shipwreck of their faith
among whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander whom I have handed over to Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme
