Esther 2
After these things when the anger of King Ahasuerus had abated he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what had been decreed against her
Then the king s young men who attended him said Let beautiful young virgins be sought out for the king
And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom to gather all the beautiful young virgins to the harem in Susa the capital under custody of Hegai the king s eunuch who is in charge of the women Let their cosmetics be given them
And let the young woman who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti This pleased the king and he did so
Now there was a Jew in Susa the citadel whose name was Mordecai the son of Jair son of Shimei son of Kish a Benjaminite
who had been carried away from Jerusalem among the captives carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away
He was bringing up Hadassah that is Esther the daughter of his uncle for she had neither father nor mother The young woman had a beautiful figure and was lovely to look at and when her father and her mother died Mordecai took her as his own daughter
So when the king s order and his edict were proclaimed and when many young women were gathered in Susa the citadel in custody of Hegai Esther also was taken into the king s palace and put in custody of Hegai who had charge of the women
And the young woman pleased him and won his favor And he quickly provided her with her cosmetics and her portion of food and with seven chosen young women from the king s palace and advanced her and her young women to the best place in the harem
Esther had not made known her people or kindred for Mordecai had commanded her not to make it known
And every day Mordecai walked in front of the court of the harem to learn how Esther was and what was happening to her
Now when the turn came for each young woman to go in to King Ahasuerus after being twelve months under the regulations for the women since this was the regular period of their beautifying six months with oil of myrrh and six months with spices and ointments for women
when the young woman went in to the king in this way she was given whatever she desired to take with her from the harem to the king s palace
In the evening she would go in and in the morning she would return to the second harem in custody of Shaashgaz the king s eunuch who was in charge of the concubines She would not go in to the king again unless the king delighted in her and she was summoned by name
When the turn came for Esther the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai who had taken her as his own daughter to go in to the king she asked for nothing except what Hegai the king s eunuch who had charge of the women advised Now Esther was winning favor in the eyes of all who saw her
And when Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal palace in the tenth month which is the month of Tebeth in the seventh year of his reign
the king loved Esther more than all the women and she won grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins so that he set the royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti
Then the king gave a great feast for all his officials and servants it was Esther s feast He also granted a remission of taxes to the provinces and gave gifts with royal generosity
Now when the virgins were gathered together the second time Mordecai was sitting at the king s gate
Esther had not made known her kindred or her people as Mordecai had commanded her for Esther obeyed Mordecai just as when she was brought up by him
In those days as Mordecai was sitting at the king s gate Bigthan and Teresh two of the king s eunuchs who guarded the threshold became angry and sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus
And this came to the knowledge of Mordecai and he told it to Queen Esther and Esther told the king in the name of Mordecai
When the affair was investigated and found to be so the men were both hanged on the gallows And it was recorded in the book of the chronicles in the presence of the king
