Genesis 7
Then the LORD said to Noah Go into the ark you and all your household for I have seen that you are righteous before me in this generation
Take with you seven pairs of all clean animals the male and his mate and a pair of the animals that are not clean the male and his mate
and seven pairs of the birds of the heavens also male and female to keep their offspring alive on the face of all the earth
For in seven days I will send rain on the earth forty days and forty nights and every living thing that I have made I will blot out from the face of the ground
And Noah did all that the LORD had commanded him
Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came upon the earth
And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons wives with him went into the ark to escape the waters of the flood
Of clean animals and of animals that are not clean and of birds and of everything that creeps on the ground
two and two male and female went into the ark with Noah as God had commanded Noah
And after seven days the waters of the flood came upon the earth
In the six hundredth year of Noah s life in the second month on the seventeenth day of the month on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst forth and the windows of the heavens were opened
And rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights
On the very same day Noah and his sons Shem and Ham and Japheth and Noah s wife and the three wives of his sons with them entered the ark
they and every beast according to its kind and all the livestock according to their kinds and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth according to its kind and every bird according to its kind every winged creature
They went into the ark with Noah two and two of all flesh in which there was the breath of life
And those that entered male and female of all flesh went in as God had commanded him And the LORD shut him in
The flood continued forty days on the earth The waters increased and bore up the ark and it rose high above the earth
The waters prevailed and increased greatly on the earth and the ark floated on the face of the waters
And the waters prevailed so mightily on the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered
The waters prevailed above the mountains covering them fifteen cubits deep
And all flesh died that moved on the earth birds livestock beasts all swarming creatures that swarm on the earth and all mankind
Everything on the dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of life died
He blotted out every living thing that was on the face of the ground man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens They were blotted out from the earth Only Noah was left and those who were with him in the ark
And the waters prevailed on the earth days
