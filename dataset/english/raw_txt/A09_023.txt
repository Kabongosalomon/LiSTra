1 Samuel 23
Now they told David Behold the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and are robbing the threshing floors
Therefore David inquired of the LORD Shall I go and attack these Philistines And the LORD said to David Go and attack the Philistines and save Keilah
But David s men said to him Behold we are afraid here in Judah how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines
Then David inquired of the LORD again And the LORD answered him Arise go down to Keilah for I will give the Philistines into your hand
And David and his men went to Keilah and fought with the Philistines and brought away their livestock and struck them with a great blow So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah
When Abiathar the son of Ahimelech had fled to David to Keilah he had come down with an ephod in his hand
Now it was told Saul that David had come to Keilah And Saul said God has given him into my hand for he has shut himself in by entering a town that has gates and bars
And Saul summoned all the people to war to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men
David knew that Saul was plotting harm against him And he said to Abiathar the priest Bring the ephod here
Then said David O LORD the God of Israel your servant has surely heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah to destroy the city on my account
Will the men of Keilah surrender me into his hand Will Saul come down as your servant has heard O LORD the God of Israel please tell your servant And the LORD said He will come down
Then David said Will the men of Keilah surrender me and my men into the hand of Saul And the LORD said They will surrender you
Then David and his men who were about six hundred arose and departed from Keilah and they went wherever they could go When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah he gave up the expedition
And David remained in the strongholds in the wilderness in the hill country of the wilderness of Ziph And Saul sought him every day but God did not give him into his hand
David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life David was in the wilderness of Ziph at Horesh
And Jonathan Saul s son rose and went to David at Horesh and strengthened his hand in God
And he said to him Do not fear for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you You shall be king over Israel and I shall be next to you Saul my father also knows this
And the two of them made a covenant before the LORD David remained at Horesh and Jonathan went home
Then the Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah saying Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh on the hill of Hachilah which is south of Jeshimon
Now come down O king according to all your heart s desire to come down and our part shall be to surrender him into the king s hand
And Saul said May you be blessed by the LORD for you have had compassion on me
Go make yet more sure Know and see the place where his foot is and who has seen him there for it is told me that he is very cunning
See therefore and take note of all the lurking places where he hides and come back to me with sure information Then I will go with you And if he is in the land I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah
And they arose and went to Ziph ahead of Saul Now David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon in the Arabah to the south of Jeshimon
And Saul and his men went to seek him And David was told so he went down to the rock and lived in the wilderness of Maon And when Saul heard that he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon
Saul went on one side of the mountain and David and his men on the other side of the mountain And David was hurrying to get away from Saul As Saul and his men were closing in on David and his men to capture them
a messenger came to Saul saying Hurry and come for the Philistines have made a raid against the land
So Saul returned from pursuing after David and went against the Philistines Therefore that place was called the Rock of Escape
And David went up from there and lived in the strongholds of Engedi
