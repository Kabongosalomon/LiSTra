1 Kings 1
Now King David was old and advanced in years And although they covered him with clothes he could not get warm
Therefore his servants said to him Let a young woman be sought for my lord the king and let her wait on the king and be in his service Let her lie in your arms that my lord the king may be warm
So they sought for a beautiful young woman throughout all the territory of Israel and found Abishag the Shunammite and brought her to the king
The young woman was very beautiful and she was of service to the king and attended to him but the king knew her not
Now Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself saying I will be king And he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen and fifty men to run before him
His father had never at any time displeased him by asking Why have you done thus and so He was also a very handsome man and he was born next after Absalom
He conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest And they followed Adonijah and helped him
But Zadok the priest and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and Nathan the prophet and Shimei and Rei and David s mighty men were not with Adonijah
Adonijah sacrificed sheep oxen and fattened cattle by the Serpent s Stone which is beside En rogel and he invited all his brothers the king s sons and all the royal officials of Judah
but he did not invite Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the mighty men or Solomon his brother
Then Nathan said to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king and David our lord does not know it
Now therefore come let me give you advice that you may save your own life and the life of your son Solomon
Go in at once to King David and say to him Did you not my lord the king swear to your servant saying Solomon your son shall reign after me and he shall sit on my throne Why then is Adonijah king
Then while you are still speaking with the king I also will come in after you and confirm your words
So Bathsheba went to the king in his chamber now the king was very old and Abishag the Shunammite was attending to the king
Bathsheba bowed and paid homage to the king and the king said What do you desire
She said to him My lord you swore to your servant by the LORD your God saying Solomon your son shall reign after me and he shall sit on my throne
And now behold Adonijah is king although you my lord the king do not know it
He has sacrificed oxen fattened cattle and sheep in abundance and has invited all the sons of the king Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army but Solomon your servant he has not invited
And now my lord the king the eyes of all Israel are on you to tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him
Otherwise it will come to pass when my lord the king sleeps with his fathers that I and my son Solomon will be counted offenders
While she was still speaking with the king Nathan the prophet came in
And they told the king Here is Nathan the prophet And when he came in before the king he bowed before the king with his face to the ground
And Nathan said My lord the king have you said Adonijah shall reign after me and he shall sit on my throne
For he has gone down this day and has sacrificed oxen fattened cattle and sheep in abundance and has invited all the king s sons the commanders of the army and Abiathar the priest And behold they are eating and drinking before him and saying Long live King Adonijah
But me your servant and Zadok the priest and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and your servant Solomon he has not invited
Has this thing been brought about by my lord the king and you have not told your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him
Then King David answered Call Bathsheba to me So she came into the king s presence and stood before the king
And the king swore saying As the LORD lives who has redeemed my soul out of every adversity
as I swore to you by the LORD the God of Israel saying Solomon your son shall reign after me and he shall sit on my throne in my place even so will I do this day
Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the ground and paid homage to the king and said May my lord King David live forever
King David said Call to me Zadok the priest Nathan the prophet and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada So they came before the king
And the king said to them Take with you the servants of your lord and have Solomon my son ride on my own mule and bring him down to Gihon
And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet there anoint him king over Israel Then blow the trumpet and say Long live King Solomon
You shall then come up after him and he shall come and sit on my throne for he shall be king in my place And I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah
And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king Amen May the LORD the God of my lord the king say so
As the LORD has been with my lord the king even so may he be with Solomon and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David
So Zadok the priest Nathan the prophet and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and the Cherethites and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon ride on King David s mule and brought him to Gihon
There Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the tent and anointed Solomon Then they blew the trumpet and all the people said Long live King Solomon
And all the people went up after him playing on pipes and rejoicing with great joy so that the earth was split by their noise
Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they finished feasting And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet he said What does this uproar in the city mean
While he was still speaking behold Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came And Adonijah said Come in for you are a worthy man and bring good news
Jonathan answered Adonijah No for our lord King David has made Solomon king
and the king has sent with him Zadok the priest Nathan the prophet and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and the Cherethites and the Pelethites And they had him ride on the king s mule
And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon and they have gone up from there rejoicing so that the city is in an uproar This is the noise that you have heard
Solomon sits on the royal throne
Moreover the king s servants came to congratulate our lord King David saying May your God make the name of Solomon more famous than yours and make his throne greater than your throne And the king bowed himself on the bed
And the king also said Blessed be the LORD the God of Israel who has granted someone to sit on my throne this day my own eyes seeing it
Then all the guests of Adonijah trembled and rose and each went his own way
And Adonijah feared Solomon So he arose and went and took hold of the horns of the altar
Then it was told Solomon Behold Adonijah fears King Solomon for behold he has laid hold of the horns of the altar saying Let King Solomon swear to me first that he will not put his servant to death with the sword
And Solomon said If he will show himself a worthy man not one of his hairs shall fall to the earth but if wickedness is found in him he shall die
So King Solomon sent and they brought him down from the altar And he came and paid homage to King Solomon and Solomon said to him Go to your house
