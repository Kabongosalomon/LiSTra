Numbers 36
The heads of the fathers houses of the clan of the people of Gilead the son of Machir son of Manasseh from the clans of the people of Joseph came near and spoke before Moses and before the chiefs the heads of the fathers houses of the people of Israel
They said The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the people of Israel and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters
But if they are married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the people of Israel then their inheritance will be taken from the inheritance of our fathers and added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry So it will be taken away from the lot of our inheritance
And when the jubilee of the people of Israel comes then their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry and their inheritance will be taken from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers
And Moses commanded the people of Israel according to the word of the LORD saying The tribe of the people of Joseph is right
This is what the LORD commands concerning the daughters of Zelophehad Let them marry whom they think best only they shall marry within the clan of the tribe of their father
The inheritance of the people of Israel shall not be transferred from one tribe to another for every one of the people of Israel shall hold on to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers
And every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the people of Israel shall be wife to one of the clan of the tribe of her father so that every one of the people of Israel may possess the inheritance of his fathers
So no inheritance shall be transferred from one tribe to another for each of the tribes of the people of Israel shall hold on to its own inheritance
The daughters of Zelophehad did as the LORD commanded Moses
for Mahlah Tirzah Hoglah Milcah and Noah the daughters of Zelophehad were married to sons of their father s brothers
They were married into the clans of the people of Manasseh the son of Joseph and their inheritance remained in the tribe of their father s clan
These are the commandments and the rules that the LORD commanded through Moses to the people of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho
