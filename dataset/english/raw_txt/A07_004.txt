Judges 4
And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD after Ehud died
And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan who reigned in Hazor The commander of his army was Sisera who lived in Harosheth hagoyim
Then the people of Israel cried out to the LORD for help for he had chariots of iron and he oppressed the people of Israel cruelly for twenty years
Now Deborah a prophetess the wife of Lappidoth was judging Israel at that time
She used to sit under the palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim and the people of Israel came up to her for judgment
She sent and summoned Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh naphtali and said to him Has not the LORD the God of Israel commanded you Go gather your men at Mount Tabor taking from the people of Naphtali and the people of Zebulun
And I will draw out Sisera the general of Jabin s army to meet you by the river Kishon with his chariots and his troops and I will give him into your hand
Barak said to her If you will go with me I will go but if you will not go with me I will not go
And she said I will surely go with you Nevertheless the road on which you are going will not lead to your glory for the LORD will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman Then Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh
And Barak called out Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh And men went up at his heels and Deborah went up with him
Now Heber the Kenite had separated from the Kenites the descendants of Hobab the father in law of Moses and had pitched his tent as far away as the oak in Zaanannim which is near Kedesh
When Sisera was told that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor
Sisera called out all his chariots chariots of iron and all the men who were with him from Harosheth hagoyim to the river Kishon
And Deborah said to Barak Up For this is the day in which the LORD has given Sisera into your hand Does not the LORD go out before you So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with men following him
And the LORD routed Sisera and all his chariots and all his army before Barak by the edge of the sword And Sisera got down from his chariot and fled away on foot
And Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth hagoyim and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword not a man was left
But Sisera fled away on foot to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite
And Jael came out to meet Sisera and said to him Turn aside my lord turn aside to me do not be afraid So he turned aside to her into the tent and she covered him with a rug
And he said to her Please give me a little water to drink for I am thirsty So she opened a skin of milk and gave him a drink and covered him
And he said to her Stand at the opening of the tent and if any man comes and asks you Is anyone here say No
But Jael the wife of Heber took a tent peg and took a hammer in her hand Then she went softly to him and drove the peg into his temple until it went down into the ground while he was lying fast asleep from weariness So he died
And behold as Barak was pursuing Sisera Jael went out to meet him and said to him Come and I will show you the man whom you are seeking So he went in to her tent and there lay Sisera dead with the tent peg in his temple
So on that day God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the people of Israel
And the hand of the people of Israel pressed harder and harder against Jabin the king of Canaan until they destroyed Jabin king of Canaan
