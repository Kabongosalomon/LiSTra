Joshua 14
These are the inheritances that the people of Israel received in the land of Canaan which Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of the fathers houses of the tribes of the people of Israel gave them to inherit
Their inheritance was by lot just as the LORD had commanded by the hand of Moses for the nine and one half tribes
For Moses had given an inheritance to the two and one half tribes beyond the Jordan but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them
For the people of Joseph were two tribes Manasseh and Ephraim And no portion was given to the Levites in the land but only cities to dwell in with their pasturelands for their livestock and their substance
The people of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses they allotted the land
Then the people of Judah came to Joshua at Gilgal And Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him You know what the LORD said to Moses the man of God in Kadesh barnea concerning you and me
I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh barnea to spy out the land and I brought him word again as it was in my heart
But my brothers who went up with me made the heart of the people melt yet I wholly followed the LORD my God
And Moses swore on that day saying Surely the land on which your foot has trodden shall be an inheritance for you and your children forever because you have wholly followed the LORD my God
And now behold the LORD has kept me alive just as he said these forty five years since the time that the LORD spoke this word to Moses while Israel walked in the wilderness And now behold I am this day eighty five years old
I am still as strong today as I was in the day that Moses sent me my strength now is as my strength was then for war and for going and coming
So now give me this hill country of which the LORD spoke on that day for you heard on that day how the Anakim were there with great fortified cities It may be that the LORD will be with me and I shall drive them out just as the LORD said
Then Joshua blessed him and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance
Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day because he wholly followed the LORD the God of Israel
Now the name of Hebron formerly was Kiriath arba Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim And the land had rest from war
