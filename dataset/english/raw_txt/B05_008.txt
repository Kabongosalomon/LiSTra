Acts 8
And Saul approved of his execution And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church in Jerusalem and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria except the apostles
Devout men buried Stephen and made great lamentation over him
But Saul was ravaging the church and entering house after house he dragged off men and women and committed them to prison
Now those who were scattered went about preaching the word
Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed to them the Christ
And the crowds with one accord paid attention to what was being said by Philip when they heard him and saw the signs that he did
For unclean spirits crying out with a loud voice came out of many who had them and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed
So there was much joy in that city
But there was a man named Simon who had previously practiced magic in the city and amazed the people of Samaria saying that he himself was somebody great
They all paid attention to him from the least to the greatest saying This man is the power of God that is called Great
And they paid attention to him because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic
But when they believed Philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ they were baptized both men and women
Even Simon himself believed and after being baptized he continued with Philip And seeing signs and great miracles performed he was amazed
Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God they sent to them Peter and John
who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit
for he had not yet fallen on any of them but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit
Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles hands he offered them money
saying Give me this power also so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit
But Peter said to him May your silver perish with you because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money
You have neither part nor lot in this matter for your heart is not right before God
Repent therefore of this wickedness of yours and pray to the Lord that if possible the intent of your heart may be forgiven you
For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity
And Simon answered Pray for me to the Lord that nothing of what you have said may come upon me
Now when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord they returned to Jerusalem preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans
Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip Rise and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza This is a desert place
And he rose and went And there was an Ethiopian a eunuch a court official of Candace queen of the Ethiopians who was in charge of all her treasure He had come to Jerusalem to worship
and was returning seated in his chariot and he was reading the prophet Isaiah
And the Spirit said to Philip Go over and join this chariot
So Philip ran to him and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet and asked Do you understand what you are reading
And he said How can I unless someone guides me And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him
Now the passage of the Scripture that he was reading was this Like a sheep he was led to the slaughter and like a lamb before its shearer is silent so he opens not his mouth
In his humiliation justice was denied him Who can describe his generation For his life is taken away from the earth
And the eunuch said to Philip About whom I ask you does the prophet say this about himself or about someone else
Then Philip opened his mouth and beginning with this Scripture he told him the good news about Jesus
And as they were going along the road they came to some water and the eunuch said See here is water What prevents me from being baptized
And he commanded the chariot to stop and they both went down into the water Philip and the eunuch and he baptized him
And when they came up out of the water the Spirit of the Lord carried Philip away and the eunuch saw him no more and went on his way rejoicing
But Philip found himself at Azotus and as he passed through he preached the gospel to all the towns until he came to Caesarea
