Isaiah 12
You will say in that day I will give thanks to you O LORD for though you were angry with me your anger turned away that you might comfort me
Behold God is my salvation I will trust and will not be afraid for the LORD GOD is my strength and my song and he has become my salvation
With joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation
And you will say in that day Give thanks to the LORD call upon his name make known his deeds among the peoples proclaim that his name is exalted
Sing praises to the LORD for he has done gloriously let this be made known in all the earth
Shout and sing for joy O inhabitant of Zion for great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel
