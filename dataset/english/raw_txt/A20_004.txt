Proverbs 4
Hear O sons a father s instruction and be attentive that you may gain insight
for I give you good precepts do not forsake my teaching
When I was a son with my father tender the only one in the sight of my mother
he taught me and said to me Let your heart hold fast my words keep my commandments and live
Get wisdom get insight do not forget and do not turn away from the words of my mouth
Do not forsake her and she will keep you love her and she will guard you
The beginning of wisdom is this Get wisdom and whatever you get get insight
Prize her highly and she will exalt you she will honor you if you embrace her
She will place on your head a graceful garland she will bestow on you a beautiful crown
Hear my son and accept my words that the years of your life may be many
I have taught you the way of wisdom I have led you in the paths of uprightness
When you walk your step will not be hampered and if you run you will not stumble
Keep hold of instruction do not let go guard her for she is your life
Do not enter the path of the wicked and do not walk in the way of the evil
Avoid it do not go on it turn away from it and pass on
For they cannot sleep unless they have done wrong they are robbed of sleep unless they have made someone stumble
For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence
But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn which shines brighter and brighter until full day
The way of the wicked is like deep darkness they do not know over what they stumble
My son be attentive to my words incline your ear to my sayings
Let them not escape from your sight keep them within your heart
For they are life to those who find them and healing to all their flesh
Keep your heart with all vigilance for from it flow the springs of life
Put away from you crooked speech and put devious talk far from you
Let your eyes look directly forward and your gaze be straight before you
Ponder the path of your feet then all your ways will be sure
Do not swerve to the right or to the left turn your foot away from evil
