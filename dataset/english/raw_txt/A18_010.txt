Job 10
I loathe my life I will give free utterance to my complaint I will speak in the bitterness of my soul
I will say to God Do not condemn me let me know why you contend against me
Does it seem good to you to oppress to despise the work of your hands and favor the designs of the wicked
Have you eyes of flesh Do you see as man sees
Are your days as the days of man or your years as a man s years
that you seek out my iniquity and search for my sin
although you know that I am not guilty and there is none to deliver out of your hand
Your hands fashioned and made me and now you have destroyed me altogether
Remember that you have made me like clay and will you return me to the dust
Did you not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese
You clothed me with skin and flesh and knit me together with bones and sinews
You have granted me life and steadfast love and your care has preserved my spirit
Yet these things you hid in your heart I know that this was your purpose
If I sin you watch me and do not acquit me of my iniquity
If I am guilty woe to me If I am in the right I cannot lift up my head for I am filled with disgrace and look on my affliction
And were my head lifted up you would hunt me like a lion and again work wonders against me
You renew your witnesses against me and increase your vexation toward me you bring fresh troops against me
Why did you bring me out from the womb Would that I had died before any eye had seen me
and were as though I had not been carried from the womb to the grave
Are not my days few Then cease and leave me alone that I may find a little cheer
before I go and I shall not return to the land of darkness and deep shadow
the land of gloom like thick darkness like deep shadow without any order where light is as thick darkness
