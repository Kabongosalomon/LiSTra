Daniel 2
In the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar had dreams his spirit was troubled and his sleep left him
Then the king commanded that the magicians the enchanters the sorcerers and the Chaldeans be summoned to tell the king his dreams So they came in and stood before the king
And the king said to them I had a dream and my spirit is troubled to know the dream
Then the Chaldeans said to the king in Aramaic O king live forever Tell your servants the dream and we will show the interpretation
The king answered and said to the Chaldeans The word from me is firm if you do not make known to me the dream and its interpretation you shall be torn limb from limb and your houses shall be laid in ruins
But if you show the dream and its interpretation you shall receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor Therefore show me the dream and its interpretation
They answered a second time and said Let the king tell his servants the dream and we will show its interpretation
The king answered and said I know with certainty that you are trying to gain time because you see that the word from me is firm
if you do not make the dream known to me there is but one sentence for you You have agreed to speak lying and corrupt words before me till the times change Therefore tell me the dream and I shall know that you can show me its interpretation
The Chaldeans answered the king and said There is not a man on earth who can meet the king s demand for no great and powerful king has asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or Chaldean
The thing that the king asks is difficult and no one can show it to the king except the gods whose dwelling is not with flesh
Because of this the king was angry and very furious and commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be destroyed
So the decree went out and the wise men were about to be killed and they sought Daniel and his companions to kill them
Then Daniel replied with prudence and discretion to Arioch the captain of the king s guard who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon
He declared to Arioch the king s captain Why is the decree of the king so urgent Then Arioch made the matter known to Daniel
And Daniel went in and requested the king to appoint him a time that he might show the interpretation to the king
Then Daniel went to his house and made the matter known to Hananiah Mishael and Azariah his companions
and told them to seek mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery so that Daniel and his companions might not be destroyed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon
Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven
Daniel answered and said Blessed be the name of God forever and ever to whom belong wisdom and might
He changes times and seasons he removes kings and sets up kings he gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who have understanding
he reveals deep and hidden things he knows what is in the darkness and the light dwells with him
To you O God of my fathers I give thanks and praise for you have given me wisdom and might and have now made known to me what we asked of you for you have made known to us the king s matter
Therefore Daniel went in to Arioch whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon He went and said thus to him Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon bring me in before the king and I will show the king the interpretation
Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste and said thus to him I have found among the exiles from Judah a man who will make known to the king the interpretation
The king declared to Daniel whose name was Belteshazzar Are you able to make known to me the dream that I have seen and its interpretation
Daniel answered the king and said No wise men enchanters magicians or astrologers can show to the king the mystery that the king has asked
but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will be in the latter days Your dream and the visions of your head as you lay in bed are these
To you O king as you lay in bed came thoughts of what would be after this and he who reveals mysteries made known to you what is to be
But as for me this mystery has been revealed to me not because of any wisdom that I have more than all the living but in order that the interpretation may be made known to the king and that you may know the thoughts of your mind
You saw O king and behold a great image This image mighty and of exceeding brightness stood before you and its appearance was frightening
The head of this image was of fine gold its chest and arms of silver its middle and thighs of bronze
its legs of iron its feet partly of iron and partly of clay
As you looked a stone was cut out by no human hand and it struck the image on its feet of iron and clay and broke them in pieces
Then the iron the clay the bronze the silver and the gold all together were broken in pieces and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors and the wind carried them away so that not a trace of them could be found But the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth
This was the dream Now we will tell the king its interpretation
You O king the king of kings to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom the power and the might and the glory
and into whose hand he has given wherever they dwell the children of man the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens making you rule over them all you are the head of gold
Another kingdom inferior to you shall arise after you and yet a third kingdom of bronze which shall rule over all the earth
And there shall be a fourth kingdom strong as iron because iron breaks to pieces and shatters all things And like iron that crushes it shall break and crush all these
And as you saw the feet and toes partly of potter s clay and partly of iron it shall be a divided kingdom but some of the firmness of iron shall be in it just as you saw iron mixed with the soft clay
And as the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly brittle
As you saw the iron mixed with soft clay so they will mix with one another in marriage but they will not hold together just as iron does not mix with clay
And in the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed nor shall the kingdom be left to another people It shall break in pieces all these kingdoms and bring them to an end and it shall stand forever
just as you saw that a stone was cut from a mountain by no human hand and that it broke in pieces the iron the bronze the clay the silver and the gold A great God has made known to the king what shall be after this The dream is certain and its interpretation sure
Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and paid homage to Daniel and commanded that an offering and incense be offered up to him
The king answered and said to Daniel Truly your God is God of gods and Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries for you have been able to reveal this mystery
Then the king gave Daniel high honors and many great gifts and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon
Daniel made a request of the king and he appointed Shadrach Meshach and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon But Daniel remained at the king s court
