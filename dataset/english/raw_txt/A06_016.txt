Joshua 16
The allotment of the people of Joseph went from the Jordan by Jericho east of the waters of Jericho into the wilderness going up from Jericho into the hill country to Bethel
Then going from Bethel to Luz it passes along to Ataroth the territory of the Archites
Then it goes down westward to the territory of the Japhletites as far as the territory of Lower Beth horon then to Gezer and it ends at the sea
The people of Joseph Manasseh and Ephraim received their inheritance
The territory of the people of Ephraim by their clans was as follows the boundary of their inheritance on the east was Ataroth addar as far as Upper Beth horon
and the boundary goes from there to the sea On the north is Michmethath Then on the east the boundary turns around toward Taanath shiloh and passes along beyond it on the east to Janoah
then it goes down from Janoah to Ataroth and to Naarah and touches Jericho ending at the Jordan
From Tappuah the boundary goes westward to the brook Kanah and ends at the sea Such is the inheritance of the tribe of the people of Ephraim by their clans
together with the towns that were set apart for the people of Ephraim within the inheritance of the Manassites all those towns with their villages
However they did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer so the Canaanites have lived in the midst of Ephraim to this day but have been made to do forced labor
