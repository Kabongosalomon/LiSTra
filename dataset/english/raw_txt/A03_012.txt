Leviticus 12
The LORD spoke to Moses saying
Speak to the people of Israel saying If a woman conceives and bears a male child then she shall be unclean seven days As at the time of her menstruation she shall be unclean
And on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised
Then she shall continue for thirty three days in the blood of her purifying She shall not touch anything holy nor come into the sanctuary until the days of her purifying are completed
But if she bears a female child then she shall be unclean two weeks as in her menstruation And she shall continue in the blood of her purifying for sixty six days
And when the days of her purifying are completed whether for a son or for a daughter she shall bring to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting a lamb a year old for a burnt offering and a pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering
and he shall offer it before the LORD and make atonement for her Then she shall be clean from the flow of her blood This is the law for her who bears a child either male or female
And if she cannot afford a lamb then she shall take two turtledoves or two pigeons one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering And the priest shall make atonement for her and she shall be clean
