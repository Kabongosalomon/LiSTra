Proverbs 26
Like snow in summer or rain in harvest so honor is not fitting for a fool
Like a sparrow in its flitting like a swallow in its flying a curse that is causeless does not alight
A whip for the horse a bridle for the donkey and a rod for the back of fools
Answer not a fool according to his folly lest you be like him yourself
Answer a fool according to his folly lest he be wise in his own eyes
Whoever sends a message by the hand of a fool cuts off his own feet and drinks violence
Like a lame man s legs which hang useless is a proverb in the mouth of fools
Like one who binds the stone in the sling is one who gives honor to a fool
Like a thorn that goes up into the hand of a drunkard is a proverb in the mouth of fools
Like an archer who wounds everyone is one who hires a passing fool or drunkard
Like a dog that returns to his vomit is a fool who repeats his folly
Do you see a man who is wise in his own eyes There is more hope for a fool than for him
The sluggard says There is a lion in the road There is a lion in the streets
As a door turns on its hinges so does a sluggard on his bed
The sluggard buries his hand in the dish it wears him out to bring it back to his mouth
The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes than seven men who can answer sensibly
Whoever meddles in a quarrel not his own is like one who takes a passing dog by the ears
Like a madman who throws firebrands arrows and death
is the man who deceives his neighbor and says I am only joking
For lack of wood the fire goes out and where there is no whisperer quarreling ceases
As charcoal to hot embers and wood to fire so is a quarrelsome man for kindling strife
The words of a whisperer are like delicious morsels they go down into the inner parts of the body
Like the glaze covering an earthen vessel are fervent lips with an evil heart
Whoever hates disguises himself with his lips and harbors deceit in his heart
when he speaks graciously believe him not for there are seven abominations in his heart
though his hatred be covered with deception his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly
Whoever digs a pit will fall into it and a stone will come back on him who starts it rolling
A lying tongue hates its victims and a flattering mouth works ruin
