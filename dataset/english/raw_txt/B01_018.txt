Matthew 18
At that time the disciples came to Jesus saying Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven
And calling to him a child he put him in the midst of them
and said Truly I say to you unless you turn and become like children you will never enter the kingdom of heaven
Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven
Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me
but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened around his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea
Woe to the world for temptations to sin For it is necessary that temptations come but woe to the one by whom the temptation comes
And if your hand or your foot causes you to sin cut it off and throw it away It is better for you to enter life crippled or lame than with two hands or two feet to be thrown into the eternal fire
And if your eye causes you to sin tear it out and throw it away It is better for you to enter life with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into the hell of fire
See that you do not despise one of these little ones For I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven
What do you think If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them has gone astray does he not leave the ninety nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray
And if he finds it truly I say to you he rejoices over it more than over the ninety nine that never went astray
So it is not the will of my Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish
If your brother sins against you go and tell him his fault between you and him alone If he listens to you you have gained your brother
But if he does not listen take one or two others along with you that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses
If he refuses to listen to them tell it to the church And if he refuses to listen even to the church let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector
Truly I say to you whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
Again I say to you if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask it will be done for them by my Father in heaven
For where two or three are gathered in my name there am I among them
Then Peter came up and said to him Lord how often will my brother sin against me and I forgive him As many as seven times
Jesus said to him I do not say to you seven times but seventy times seven
Therefore the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants
When he began to settle one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents
And since he could not pay his master ordered him to be sold with his wife and children and all that he had and payment to be made
So the servant fell on his knees imploring him Have patience with me and I will pay you everything
And out of pity for him the master of that servant released him and forgave him the debt
But when that same servant went out he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii and seizing him he began to choke him saying Pay what you owe
So his fellow servant fell down and pleaded with him Have patience with me and I will pay you
He refused and went and put him in prison until he should pay the debt
When his fellow servants saw what had taken place they were greatly distressed and they went and reported to their master all that had taken place
Then his master summoned him and said to him You wicked servant I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me
And should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant as I had mercy on you
And in anger his master delivered him to the jailers until he should pay all his debt
So also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you if you do not forgive your brother from your heart
