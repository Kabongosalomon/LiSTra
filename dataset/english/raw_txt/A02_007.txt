Exodus 7
And the LORD said to Moses See I have made you like God to Pharaoh and your brother Aaron shall be your prophet
You shall speak all that I command you and your brother Aaron shall tell Pharaoh to let the people of Israel go out of his land
But I will harden Pharaoh s heart and though I multiply my signs and wonders in the land of Egypt
Pharaoh will not listen to you Then I will lay my hand on Egypt and bring my hosts my people the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by great acts of judgment
The Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD when I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring out the people of Israel from among them
Moses and Aaron did so they did just as the LORD commanded them
Now Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty three years old when they spoke to Pharaoh
Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron
When Pharaoh says to you Prove yourselves by working a miracle then you shall say to Aaron Take your staff and cast it down before Pharaoh that it may become a serpent
So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did just as the LORD commanded Aaron cast down his staff before Pharaoh and his servants and it became a serpent
Then Pharaoh summoned the wise men and the sorcerers and they the magicians of Egypt also did the same by their secret arts
For each man cast down his staff and they became serpents But Aaron s staff swallowed up their staffs
Still Pharaoh s heart was hardened and he would not listen to them as the LORD had said
Then the LORD said to Moses Pharaoh s heart is hardened he refuses to let the people go
Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he is going out to the water Stand on the bank of the Nile to meet him and take in your hand the staff that turned into a serpent
And you shall say to him The LORD the God of the Hebrews sent me to you saying Let my people go that they may serve me in the wilderness But so far you have not obeyed
Thus says the LORD By this you shall know that I am the LORD behold with the staff that is in my hand I will strike the water that is in the Nile and it shall turn into blood
The fish in the Nile shall die and the Nile will stink and the Egyptians will grow weary of drinking water from the Nile
And the LORD said to Moses Say to Aaron Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt over their rivers their canals and their ponds and all their pools of water so that they may become blood and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt even in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone
Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded In the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants he lifted up the staff and struck the water in the Nile and all the water in the Nile turned into blood
And the fish in the Nile died and the Nile stank so that the Egyptians could not drink water from the Nile There was blood throughout all the land of Egypt
But the magicians of Egypt did the same by their secret arts So Pharaoh s heart remained hardened and he would not listen to them as the LORD had said
Pharaoh turned and went into his house and he did not take even this to heart
And all the Egyptians dug along the Nile for water to drink for they could not drink the water of the Nile
Seven full days passed after the LORD had struck the Nile
