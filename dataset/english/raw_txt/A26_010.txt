Ezekiel 10
Then I looked and behold on the expanse that was over the heads of the cherubim there appeared above them something like a sapphire in appearance like a throne
And he said to the man clothed in linen Go in among the whirling wheels underneath the cherubim Fill your hands with burning coals from between the cherubim and scatter them over the city And he went in before my eyes
Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the house when the man went in and a cloud filled the inner court
And the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub to the threshold of the house and the house was filled with the cloud and the court was filled with the brightness of the glory of the LORD
And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer court like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks
And when he commanded the man clothed in linen Take fire from between the whirling wheels from between the cherubim he went in and stood beside a wheel
And a cherub stretched out his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim and took some of it and put it into the hands of the man clothed in linen who took it and went out
The cherubim appeared to have the form of a human hand under their wings
And I looked and behold there were four wheels beside the cherubim one beside each cherub and the appearance of the wheels was like sparkling beryl
And as for their appearance the four had the same likeness as if a wheel were within a wheel
When they went they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went but in whatever direction the front wheel faced the others followed without turning as they went
And their whole body their rims and their spokes their wings and the wheels were full of eyes all around the wheels that the four of them had
As for the wheels they were called in my hearing the whirling wheels
And every one had four faces the first face was the face of the cherub and the second face was a human face and the third the face of a lion and the fourth the face of an eagle
And the cherubim mounted up These were the living creatures that I saw by the Chebar canal
And when the cherubim went the wheels went beside them And when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth the wheels did not turn from beside them
When they stood still these stood still and when they mounted up these mounted up with them for the spirit of the living creatures was in them
Then the glory of the LORD went out from the threshold of the house and stood over the cherubim
And the cherubim lifted up their wings and mounted up from the earth before my eyes as they went out with the wheels beside them And they stood at the entrance of the east gate of the house of the LORD and the glory of the God of Israel was over them
These were the living creatures that I saw underneath the God of Israel by the Chebar canal and I knew that they were cherubim
Each had four faces and each four wings and underneath their wings the likeness of human hands
And as for the likeness of their faces they were the same faces whose appearance I had seen by the Chebar canal Each one of them went straight forward
