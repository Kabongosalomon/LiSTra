Philippians 3
Finally my brothers rejoice in the Lord To write the same things to you is no trouble to me and is safe for you
Look out for the dogs look out for the evildoers look out for those who mutilate the flesh
For we are the circumcision who worship by the Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh
though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh also If anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh I have more
circumcised on the eighth day of the people of Israel of the tribe of Benjamin a Hebrew of Hebrews as to the law a Pharisee
as to zeal a persecutor of the church as to righteousness under the law blameless
But whatever gain I had I counted as loss for the sake of Christ
Indeed I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish in order that I may gain Christ
and be found in him not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law but that which comes through faith in Christ the righteousness from God that depends on faith
that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and may share his sufferings becoming like him in his death
that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead
Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect but I press on to make it my own because Christ Jesus has made me his own
Brothers I do not consider that I have made it my own But one thing I do forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead
I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus
Let those of us who are mature think this way and if in anything you think otherwise God will reveal that also to you
Only let us hold true to what we have attained
Brothers join in imitating me and keep your eyes on those who walk according to the example you have in us
For many of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears walk as enemies of the cross of Christ
Their end is destruction their god is their belly and they glory in their shame with minds set on earthly things
But our citizenship is in heaven and from it we await a Savior the Lord Jesus Christ
who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself
