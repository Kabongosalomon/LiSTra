Matthew 14
At that time Herod the tetrarch heard about the fame of Jesus
and he said to his servants This is John the Baptist He has been raised from the dead that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him
For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias his brother Philip s wife
because John had been saying to him It is not lawful for you to have her
And though he wanted to put him to death he feared the people because they held him to be a prophet
But when Herod s birthday came the daughter of Herodias danced before the company and pleased Herod
so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask
Prompted by her mother she said Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter
And the king was sorry but because of his oaths and his guests he commanded it to be given
He sent and had John beheaded in the prison
and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl and she brought it to her mother
And his disciples came and took the body and buried it and they went and told Jesus
Now when Jesus heard this he withdrew from there in a boat to a desolate place by himself But when the crowds heard it they followed him on foot from the towns
When he went ashore he saw a great crowd and he had compassion on them and healed their sick
Now when it was evening the disciples came to him and said This is a desolate place and the day is now over send the crowds away to go into the villages and buy food for themselves
But Jesus said They need not go away you give them something to eat
They said to him We have only five loaves here and two fish
And he said Bring them here to me
Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass and taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven and said a blessing Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples and the disciples gave them to the crowds
And they all ate and were satisfied And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces left over
And those who ate were about five thousand men besides women and children
Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side while he dismissed the crowds
And after he had dismissed the crowds he went up on the mountain by himself to pray When evening came he was there alone
but the boat by this time was a long way from the land beaten by the waves for the wind was against them
And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them walking on the sea
But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were terrified and said It is a ghost and they cried out in fear
But immediately Jesus spoke to them saying Take heart it is I Do not be afraid
And Peter answered him Lord if it is you command me to come to you on the water
He said Come So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus
But when he saw the wind he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried out Lord save me
Jesus immediately reached out his hand and took hold of him saying to him O you of little faith why did you doubt
And when they got into the boat the wind ceased
And those in the boat worshiped him saying Truly you are the Son of God
And when they had crossed over they came to land at Gennesaret
And when the men of that place recognized him they sent around to all that region and brought to him all who were sick
and implored him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment And as many as touched it were made well
