1 Thessalonians 5
Now concerning the times and the seasons brothers you have no need to have anything written to you
For you yourselves are fully aware that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night
While people are saying There is peace and security then sudden destruction will come upon them as labor pains come upon a pregnant woman and they will not escape
But you are not in darkness brothers for that day to surprise you like a thief
For you are all children of light children of the day We are not of the night or of the darkness
So then let us not sleep as others do but let us keep awake and be sober
For those who sleep sleep at night and those who get drunk are drunk at night
But since we belong to the day let us be sober having put on the breastplate of faith and love and for a helmet the hope of salvation
For God has not destined us for wrath but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ
who died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep we might live with him
Therefore encourage one another and build one another up just as you are doing
We ask you brothers to respect those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you
and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work Be at peace among yourselves
And we urge you brothers admonish the idle encourage the fainthearted help the weak be patient with them all
See that no one repays anyone evil for evil but always seek to do good to one another and to everyone
Rejoice always
pray without ceasing
give thanks in all circumstances for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you
Do not quench the Spirit
Do not despise prophecies
but test everything hold fast what is good
Abstain from every form of evil
Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
He who calls you is faithful he will surely do it
Brothers pray for us
Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss
I put you under oath before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you
