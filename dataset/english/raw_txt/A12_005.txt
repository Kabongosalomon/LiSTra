2 Kings 5
Naaman commander of the army of the king of Syria was a great man with his master and in high favor because by him the LORD had given victory to Syria He was a mighty man of valor but he was a leper
Now the Syrians on one of their raids had carried off a little girl from the land of Israel and she worked in the service of Naaman s wife
She said to her mistress Would that my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria He would cure him of his leprosy
So Naaman went in and told his lord Thus and so spoke the girl from the land of Israel
And the king of Syria said Go now and I will send a letter to the king of Israel So he went taking with him ten talents of silver six thousand shekels of gold and ten changes of clothing
And he brought the letter to the king of Israel which read When this letter reaches you know that I have sent to you Naaman my servant that you may cure him of his leprosy
And when the king of Israel read the letter he tore his clothes and said Am I God to kill and to make alive that this man sends word to me to cure a man of his leprosy Only consider and see how he is seeking a quarrel with me
But when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes he sent to the king saying Why have you torn your clothes Let him come now to me that he may know that there is a prophet in Israel
So Naaman came with his horses and chariots and stood at the door of Elisha s house
And Elisha sent a messenger to him saying Go and wash in the Jordan seven times and your flesh shall be restored and you shall be clean
But Naaman was angry and went away saying Behold I thought that he would surely come out to me and stand and call upon the name of the LORD his God and wave his hand over the place and cure the leper
Are not Abana and Pharpar the rivers of Damascus better than all the waters of Israel Could I not wash in them and be clean So he turned and went away in a rage
But his servants came near and said to him My father it is a great word the prophet has spoken to you will you not do it Has he actually said to you Wash and be clean
So he went down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan according to the word of the man of God and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child and he was clean
Then he returned to the man of God he and all his company and he came and stood before him And he said Behold I know that there is no God in all the earth but in Israel so accept now a present from your servant
But he said As the LORD lives before whom I stand I will receive none And he urged him to take it but he refused
Then Naaman said If not please let there be given to your servant two mules load of earth for from now on your servant will not offer burnt offering or sacrifice to any god but the LORD
In this matter may the LORD pardon your servant when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there leaning on my arm and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon when I bow myself in the house of Rimmon the LORD pardon your servant in this matter
He said to him Go in peace But when Naaman had gone from him a short distance
Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God said See my master has spared this Naaman the Syrian in not accepting from his hand what he brought As the LORD lives I will run after him and get something from him
So Gehazi followed Naaman And when Naaman saw someone running after him he got down from the chariot to meet him and said Is all well
And he said All is well My master has sent me to say There have just now come to me from the hill country of Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothing
And Naaman said Be pleased to accept two talents And he urged him and tied up two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of clothing and laid them on two of his servants And they carried them before Gehazi
And when he came to the hill he took them from their hand and put them in the house and he sent the men away and they departed
He went in and stood before his master and Elisha said to him Where have you been Gehazi And he said Your servant went nowhere
But he said to him Did not my heart go when the man turned from his chariot to meet you Was it a time to accept money and garments olive orchards and vineyards sheep and oxen male servants and female servants
Therefore the leprosy of Naaman shall cling to you and to your descendants forever So he went out from his presence a leper like snow
