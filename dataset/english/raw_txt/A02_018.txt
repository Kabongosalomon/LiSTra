Exodus 18
Jethro the priest of Midian Moses father in law heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel his people how the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt
Now Jethro Moses father in law had taken Zipporah Moses wife after he had sent her home
along with her two sons The name of the one was Gershom for he said I have been a sojourner in a foreign land
and the name of the other Eliezer for he said The God of my father was my help and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh
Jethro Moses father in law came with his sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness where he was encamped at the mountain of God
And when he sent word to Moses I your father in law Jethro am coming to you with your wife and her two sons with her
Moses went out to meet his father in law and bowed down and kissed him And they asked each other of their welfare and went into the tent
Then Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel s sake all the hardship that had come upon them in the way and how the LORD had delivered them
And Jethro rejoiced for all the good that the LORD had done to Israel in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians
Jethro said Blessed be the LORD who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh and has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians
Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods because in this affair they dealt arrogantly with the people
And Jethro Moses father in law brought a burnt offering and sacrifices to God and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses father in law before God
The next day Moses sat to judge the people and the people stood around Moses from morning till evening
When Moses father in law saw all that he was doing for the people he said What is this that you are doing for the people Why do you sit alone and all the people stand around you from morning till evening
And Moses said to his father in law Because the people come to me to inquire of God
when they have a dispute they come to me and I decide between one person and another and I make them know the statutes of God and his laws
Moses father in law said to him What you are doing is not good
You and the people with you will certainly wear yourselves out for the thing is too heavy for you You are not able to do it alone
Now obey my voice I will give you advice and God be with you You shall represent the people before God and bring their cases to God
and you shall warn them about the statutes and the laws and make them know the way in which they must walk and what they must do
Moreover look for able men from all the people men who fear God who are trustworthy and hate a bribe and place such men over the people as chiefs of thousands of hundreds of fifties and of tens
And let them judge the people at all times Every great matter they shall bring to you but any small matter they shall decide themselves So it will be easier for you and they will bear the burden with you
If you do this God will direct you you will be able to endure and all this people also will go to their place in peace
So Moses listened to the voice of his father in law and did all that he had said
Moses chose able men out of all Israel and made them heads over the people chiefs of thousands of hundreds of fifties and of tens
And they judged the people at all times Any hard case they brought to Moses but any small matter they decided themselves
Then Moses let his father in law depart and he went away to his own country
