Isaiah 36
In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them
And the king of Assyria sent the Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem with a great army And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool on the highway to the Washer s Field
And there came out to him Eliakim the son of Hilkiah who was over the household and Shebna the secretary and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder
And the Rabshakeh said to them Say to Hezekiah Thus says the great king the king of Assyria On what do you rest this trust of yours
Do you think that mere words are strategy and power for war In whom do you now trust that you have rebelled against me
Behold you are trusting in Egypt that broken reed of a staff which will pierce the hand of any man who leans on it Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him
But if you say to me We trust in the LORD our God is it not he whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed saying to Judah and to Jerusalem You shall worship before this altar
Come now make a wager with my master the king of Assyria I will give you two thousand horses if you are able on your part to set riders on them
How then can you repulse a single captain among the least of my master s servants when you trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen
Moreover is it without the LORD that I have come up against this land to destroy it The LORD said to me Go up against this land and destroy it
Then Eliakim Shebna and Joah said to the Rabshakeh Please speak to your servants in Aramaic for we understand it Do not speak to us in the language of Judah within the hearing of the people who are on the wall
But the Rabshakeh said Has my master sent me to speak these words to your master and to you and not to the men sitting on the wall who are doomed with you to eat their own dung and drink their own urine
Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out in a loud voice in the language of Judah Hear the words of the great king the king of Assyria
Thus says the king Do not let Hezekiah deceive you for he will not be able to deliver you
Do not let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD by saying The LORD will surely deliver us This city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria
Do not listen to Hezekiah For thus says the king of Assyria Make your peace with me and come out to me Then each one of you will eat of his own vine and each one of his own fig tree and each one of you will drink the water of his own cistern
until I come and take you away to a land like your own land a land of grain and wine a land of bread and vineyards
Beware lest Hezekiah mislead you by saying The LORD will deliver us Has any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria
Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad Where are the gods of Sepharvaim Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand
Who among all the gods of these lands have delivered their lands out of my hand that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand
But they were silent and answered him not a word for the king s command was Do not answer him
Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah who was over the household and Shebna the secretary and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and told him the words of the Rabshakeh
