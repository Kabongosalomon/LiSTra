Galathians 4
I mean that the heir as long as he is a child is no different from a slave though he is the owner of everything
but he is under guardians and managers until the date set by his father
In the same way we also when we were children were enslaved to the elementary principles of the world
But when the fullness of time had come God sent forth his Son born of woman born under the law
to redeem those who were under the law so that we might receive adoption as sons
And because you are sons God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts crying Abba Father
So you are no longer a slave but a son and if a son then an heir through God
Formerly when you did not know God you were enslaved to those that by nature are not gods
But now that you have come to know God or rather to be known by God how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless elementary principles of the world whose slaves you want to be once more
You observe days and months and seasons and years
I am afraid I may have labored over you in vain
Brothers I entreat you become as I am for I also have become as you are You did me no wrong
You know it was because of a bodily ailment that I preached the gospel to you at first
and though my condition was a trial to you you did not scorn or despise me but received me as an angel of God as Christ Jesus
What then has become of the blessing you felt For I testify to you that if possible you would have gouged out your eyes and given them to me
Have I then become your enemy by telling you the truth
They make much of you but for no good purpose They want to shut you out that you may make much of them
It is always good to be made much of for a good purpose and not only when I am present with you
my little children for whom I am again in the anguish of childbirth until Christ is formed in you
I wish I could be present with you now and change my tone for I am perplexed about you
Tell me you who desire to be under the law do you not listen to the law
For it is written that Abraham had two sons one by a slave woman and one by a free woman
But the son of the slave was born according to the flesh while the son of the free woman was born through promise
Now this may be interpreted allegorically these women are two covenants One is from Mount Sinai bearing children for slavery she is Hagar
Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia she corresponds to the present Jerusalem for she is in slavery with her children
But the Jerusalem above is free and she is our mother
For it is written Rejoice O barren one who does not bear break forth and cry aloud you who are not in labor For the children of the desolate one will be more than those of the one who has a husband
Now you brothers like Isaac are children of promise
But just as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit so also it is now
But what does the Scripture say Cast out the slave woman and her son for the son of the slave woman shall not inherit with the son of the free woman
So brothers we are not children of the slave but of the free woman
