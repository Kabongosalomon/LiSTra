John 1
In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God
He was in the beginning with God
All things were made through him and without him was not any thing made that was made
In him was life and the life was the light of men
The light shines in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it
There was a man sent from God whose name was John
He came as a witness to bear witness about the light that all might believe through him
He was not the light but came to bear witness about the light
The true light which enlightens everyone was coming into the world
He was in the world and the world was made through him yet the world did not know him
He came to his own and his own people did not receive him
But to all who did receive him who believed in his name he gave the right to become children of God
who were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God
And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us and we have seen his glory glory as of the only Son from the Father full of grace and truth
John bore witness about him and cried out This was he of whom I said He who comes after me ranks before me because he was before me
And from his fullness we have all received grace upon grace
For the law was given through Moses grace and truth came through Jesus Christ
No one has ever seen God the only God who is at the Father s side he has made him known
And this is the testimony of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him Who are you
He confessed and did not deny but confessed I am not the Christ
And they asked him What then Are you Elijah He said I am not Are you the Prophet And he answered No
So they said to him Who are you We need to give an answer to those who sent us What do you say about yourself
He said I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness Make straight the way of the Lord as the prophet Isaiah said
Now they had been sent from the Pharisees
They asked him Then why are you baptizing if you are neither the Christ nor Elijah nor the Prophet
John answered them I baptize with water but among you stands one you do not know
even he who comes after me the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie
These things took place in Bethany across the Jordan where John was baptizing
The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him and said Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world
This is he of whom I said After me comes a man who ranks before me because he was before me
I myself did not know him but for this purpose I came baptizing with water that he might be revealed to Israel
And John bore witness I saw the Spirit descend from heaven like a dove and it remained on him
I myself did not know him but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit
And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God
The next day again John was standing with two of his disciples
and he looked at Jesus as he walked by and said Behold the Lamb of God
The two disciples heard him say this and they followed Jesus
Jesus turned and saw them following and said to them What are you seeking And they said to him Rabbi which means Teacher where are you staying
He said to them Come and you will see So they came and saw where he was staying and they stayed with him that day for it was about the tenth hour
One of the two who heard John speak and followed Jesus was Andrew Simon Peter s brother
He first found his own brother Simon and said to him We have found the Messiah which means Christ
He brought him to Jesus Jesus looked at him and said So you are Simon the son of John You shall be called Cephas which means Peter
The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee He found Philip and said to him Follow me
Now Philip was from Bethsaida the city of Andrew and Peter
Philip found Nathanael and said to him We have found him of whom Moses in the Law and also the prophets wrote Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph
Nathanael said to him Can anything good come out of Nazareth Philip said to him Come and see
Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said of him Behold an Israelite indeed in whom there is no deceit
Nathanael said to him How do you know me Jesus answered him Before Philip called you when you were under the fig tree I saw you
Nathanael answered him Rabbi you are the Son of God You are the King of Israel
Jesus answered him Because I said to you I saw you under the fig tree do you believe You will see greater things than these
And he said to him Truly truly I say to you you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man
