Isaiah 18
Ah land of whirring wings that is beyond the rivers of Cush
which sends ambassadors by the sea in vessels of papyrus on the waters Go you swift messengers to a nation tall and smooth to a people feared near and far a nation mighty and conquering whose land the rivers divide
All you inhabitants of the world you who dwell on the earth when a signal is raised on the mountains look When a trumpet is blown hear
For thus the LORD said to me I will quietly look from my dwelling like clear heat in sunshine like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest
For before the harvest when the blossom is over and the flower becomes a ripening grape he cuts off the shoots with pruning hooks and the spreading branches he lops off and clears away
They shall all of them be left to the birds of prey of the mountains and to the beasts of the earth And the birds of prey will summer on them and all the beasts of the earth will winter on them
At that time tribute will be brought to the LORD of hosts from a people tall and smooth from a people feared near and far a nation mighty and conquering whose land the rivers divide to Mount Zion the place of the name of the LORD of hosts
