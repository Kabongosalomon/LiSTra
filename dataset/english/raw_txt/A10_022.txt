2 Samuel 22
And David spoke to the LORD the words of this song on the day when the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul
He said The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer
my God my rock in whom I take refuge my shield and the horn of my salvation my stronghold and my refuge my savior you save me from violence
I call upon the LORD who is worthy to be praised and I am saved from my enemies
For the waves of death encompassed me the torrents of destruction assailed me
the cords of Sheol entangled me the snares of death confronted me
In my distress I called upon the LORD to my God I called From his temple he heard my voice and my cry came to his ears
Then the earth reeled and rocked the foundations of the heavens trembled and quaked because he was angry
Smoke went up from his nostrils and devouring fire from his mouth glowing coals flamed forth from him
He bowed the heavens and came down thick darkness was under his feet
He rode on a cherub and flew he was seen on the wings of the wind
He made darkness around him his canopy thick clouds a gathering of water
Out of the brightness before him coals of fire flamed forth
The LORD thundered from heaven and the Most High uttered his voice
And he sent out arrows and scattered them lightning and routed them
Then the channels of the sea were seen the foundations of the world were laid bare at the rebuke of the LORD at the blast of the breath of his nostrils
He sent from on high he took me he drew me out of many waters
He rescued me from my strong enemy from those who hated me for they were too mighty for me
They confronted me in the day of my calamity but the LORD was my support
He brought me out into a broad place he rescued me because he delighted in me
The LORD dealt with me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands he rewarded me
For I have kept the ways of the LORD and have not wickedly departed from my God
For all his rules were before me and from his statutes I did not turn aside
I was blameless before him and I kept myself from guilt
And the LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness according to my cleanness in his sight
With the merciful you show yourself merciful with the blameless man you show yourself blameless
with the purified you deal purely and with the crooked you make yourself seem tortuous
You save a humble people but your eyes are on the haughty to bring them down
For you are my lamp O LORD and my God lightens my darkness
For by you I can run against a troop and by my God I can leap over a wall
This God his way is perfect the word of the LORD proves true he is a shield for all those who take refuge in him
For who is God but the LORD And who is a rock except our God
This God is my strong refuge and has made my way blameless
He made my feet like the feet of a deer and set me secure on the heights
He trains my hands for war so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze
You have given me the shield of your salvation and your gentleness made me great
You gave a wide place for my steps under me and my feet did not slip
I pursued my enemies and destroyed them and did not turn back until they were consumed
I consumed them I thrust them through so that they did not rise they fell under my feet
For you equipped me with strength for the battle you made those who rise against me sink under me
You made my enemies turn their backs to me those who hated me and I destroyed them
They looked but there was none to save they cried to the LORD but he did not answer them
I beat them fine as the dust of the earth I crushed them and stamped them down like the mire of the streets
You delivered me from strife with my people you kept me as the head of the nations people whom I had not known served me
Foreigners came cringing to me as soon as they heard of me they obeyed me
Foreigners lost heart and came trembling out of their fortresses
The LORD lives and blessed be my rock and exalted be my God the rock of my salvation
the God who gave me vengeance and brought down peoples under me
who brought me out from my enemies you exalted me above those who rose against me you delivered me from men of violence
For this I will praise you O LORD among the nations and sing praises to your name
Great salvation he brings to his king and shows steadfast love to his anointed to David and his offspring forever
