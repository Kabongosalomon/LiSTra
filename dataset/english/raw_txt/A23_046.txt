Isaiah 46
Bel bows down Nebo stoops their idols are on beasts and livestock these things you carry are borne as burdens on weary beasts
They stoop they bow down together they cannot save the burden but themselves go into captivity
Listen to me O house of Jacob all the remnant of the house of Israel who have been borne by me from before your birth carried from the womb
even to your old age I am he and to gray hairs I will carry you I have made and I will bear I will carry and will save
To whom will you liken me and make me equal and compare me that we may be alike
Those who lavish gold from the purse and weigh out silver in the scales hire a goldsmith and he makes it into a god then they fall down and worship
They lift it to their shoulders they carry it they set it in its place and it stands there it cannot move from its place If one cries to it it does not answer or save him from his trouble
Remember this and stand firm recall it to mind you transgressors
remember the former things of old for I am God and there is no other I am God and there is none like me
declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things not yet done saying My counsel shall stand and I will accomplish all my purpose
calling a bird of prey from the east the man of my counsel from a far country I have spoken and I will bring it to pass I have purposed and I will do it
Listen to me you stubborn of heart you who are far from righteousness
I bring near my righteousness it is not far off and my salvation will not delay I will put salvation in Zion for Israel my glory
