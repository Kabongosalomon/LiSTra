Proverbs 23
When you sit down to eat with a ruler observe carefully what is before you
and put a knife to your throat if you are given to appetite
Do not desire his delicacies for they are deceptive food
Do not toil to acquire wealth be discerning enough to desist
When your eyes light on it it is gone for suddenly it sprouts wings flying like an eagle toward heaven
Do not eat the bread of a man who is stingy do not desire his delicacies
for he is like one who is inwardly calculating Eat and drink he says to you but his heart is not with you
You will vomit up the morsels that you have eaten and waste your pleasant words
Do not speak in the hearing of a fool for he will despise the good sense of your words
Do not move an ancient landmark or enter the fields of the fatherless
for their Redeemer is strong he will plead their cause against you
Apply your heart to instruction and your ear to words of knowledge
Do not withhold discipline from a child if you strike him with a rod he will not die
If you strike him with the rod you will save his soul from Sheol
My son if your heart is wise my heart too will be glad
My inmost being will exult when your lips speak what is right
Let not your heart envy sinners but continue in the fear of the LORD all the day
Surely there is a future and your hope will not be cut off
Hear my son and be wise and direct your heart in the way
Be not among drunkards or among gluttonous eaters of meat
for the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty and slumber will clothe them with rags
Listen to your father who gave you life and do not despise your mother when she is old
Buy truth and do not sell it buy wisdom instruction and understanding
The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice he who fathers a wise son will be glad in him
Let your father and mother be glad let her who bore you rejoice
My son give me your heart and let your eyes observe my ways
For a prostitute is a deep pit an adulteress is a narrow well
She lies in wait like a robber and increases the traitors among mankind
Who has woe Who has sorrow Who has strife Who has complaining Who has wounds without cause Who has redness of eyes
Those who tarry long over wine those who go to try mixed wine
Do not look at wine when it is red when it sparkles in the cup and goes down smoothly
In the end it bites like a serpent and stings like an adder
Your eyes will see strange things and your heart utter perverse things
You will be like one who lies down in the midst of the sea like one who lies on the top of a mast
They struck me you will say but I was not hurt they beat me but I did not feel it When shall I awake I must have another drink
