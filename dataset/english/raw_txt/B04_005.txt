John 5
After this there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem
Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool in Aramaic called Bethesda which has five roofed colonnades
In these lay a multitude of invalids blind lame and paralyzed
One man was there who had been an invalid for thirty eight years
When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had already been there a long time he said to him Do you want to be healed
The sick man answered him Sir I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up and while I am going another steps down before me
Jesus said to him Get up take up your bed and walk
And at once the man was healed and he took up his bed and walked Now that day was the Sabbath
So the Jews said to the man who had been healed It is the Sabbath and it is not lawful for you to take up your bed
But he answered them The man who healed me that man said to me Take up your bed and walk
They asked him Who is the man who said to you Take up your bed and walk
Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was for Jesus had withdrawn as there was a crowd in the place
Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him See you are well Sin no more that nothing worse may happen to you
The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him
And this was why the Jews were persecuting Jesus because he was doing these things on the Sabbath
But Jesus answered them My Father is working until now and I am working
This was why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him because not only was he breaking the Sabbath but he was even calling God his own Father making himself equal with God
So Jesus said to them Truly truly I say to you the Son can do nothing of his own accord but only what he sees the Father doing For whatever the Father does that the Son does likewise
For the Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing And greater works than these will he show him so that you may marvel
For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life so also the Son gives life to whom he will
The Father judges no one but has given all judgment to the Son
that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him
Truly truly I say to you whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life He does not come into judgment but has passed from death to life
Truly truly I say to you an hour is coming and is now here when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live
For as the Father has life in himself so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself
And he has given him authority to execute judgment because he is the Son of Man
Do not marvel at this for an hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice
and come out those who have done good to the resurrection of life and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment
I can do nothing on my own As I hear I judge and my judgment is just because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me
If I alone bear witness about myself my testimony is not deemed true
There is another who bears witness about me and I know that the testimony that he bears about me is true
You sent to John and he has borne witness to the truth
Not that the testimony that I receive is from man but I say these things so that you may be saved
He was a burning and shining lamp and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light
But the testimony that I have is greater than that of John For the works that the Father has given me to accomplish the very works that I am doing bear witness about me that the Father has sent me
And the Father who sent me has himself borne witness about me His voice you have never heard his form you have never seen
and you do not have his word abiding in you for you do not believe the one whom he has sent
You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life and it is they that bear witness about me
yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life
I do not receive glory from people
But I know that you do not have the love of God within you
I have come in my Father s name and you do not receive me If another comes in his own name you will receive him
How can you believe when you receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God
Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father There is one who accuses you Moses on whom you have set your hope
For if you believed Moses you would believe me for he wrote of me
But if you do not believe his writings how will you believe my words
