Proverbs 30
The words of Agur son of Jakeh The oracle The man declares I am weary O God I am weary O God and worn out
Surely I am too stupid to be a man I have not the understanding of a man
I have not learned wisdom nor have I knowledge of the Holy One
Who has ascended to heaven and come down Who has gathered the wind in his fists Who has wrapped up the waters in a garment Who has established all the ends of the earth What is his name and what is his son s name Surely you know
Every word of God proves true he is a shield to those who take refuge in him
Do not add to his words lest he rebuke you and you be found a liar
Two things I ask of you deny them not to me before I die
Remove far from me falsehood and lying give me neither poverty nor riches feed me with the food that is needful for me
lest I be full and deny you and say Who is the LORD or lest I be poor and steal and profane the name of my God
Do not slander a servant to his master lest he curse you and you be held guilty
There are those who curse their fathers and do not bless their mothers
There are those who are clean in their own eyes but are not washed of their filth
There are those how lofty are their eyes how high their eyelids lift
There are those whose teeth are swords whose fangs are knives to devour the poor from off the earth the needy from among mankind
The leech has two daughters Give and Give Three things are never satisfied four never say Enough
Sheol the barren womb the land never satisfied with water and the fire that never says Enough
The eye that mocks a father and scorns to obey a mother will be picked out by the ravens of the valley and eaten by the vultures
Three things are too wonderful for me four I do not understand
the way of an eagle in the sky the way of a serpent on a rock the way of a ship on the high seas and the way of a man with a virgin
This is the way of an adulteress she eats and wipes her mouth and says I have done no wrong
Under three things the earth trembles under four it cannot bear up
a slave when he becomes king and a fool when he is filled with food
an unloved woman when she gets a husband and a maidservant when she displaces her mistress
Four things on earth are small but they are exceedingly wise
the ants are a people not strong yet they provide their food in the summer
the rock badgers are a people not mighty yet they make their homes in the cliffs
the locusts have no king yet all of them march in rank
the lizard you can take in your hands yet it is in kings palaces
Three things are stately in their tread four are stately in their stride
the lion which is mightiest among beasts and does not turn back before any
the strutting rooster the he goat and a king whose army is with him
If you have been foolish exalting yourself or if you have been devising evil put your hand on your mouth
For pressing milk produces curds pressing the nose produces blood and pressing anger produces strife
