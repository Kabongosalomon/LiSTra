Matthew 4
Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil
And after fasting forty days and forty nights he was hungry
And the tempter came and said to him If you are the Son of God command these stones to become loaves of bread
But he answered It is written Man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that comes from the mouth of God
Then the devil took him to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple
and said to him If you are the Son of God throw yourself down for it is written He will command his angels concerning you and On their hands they will bear you up lest you strike your foot against a stone
Jesus said to him Again it is written You shall not put the Lord your God to the test
Again the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory
And he said to him All these I will give you if you will fall down and worship me
Then Jesus said to him Be gone Satan For it is written You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve
Then the devil left him and behold angels came and were ministering to him
Now when he heard that John had been arrested he withdrew into Galilee
And leaving Nazareth he went and lived in Capernaum by the sea in the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali
so that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled
The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali the way of the sea beyond the Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles
the people dwelling in darkness have seen a great light and for those dwelling in the region and shadow of death on them a light has dawned
From that time Jesus began to preach saying Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand
While walking by the Sea of Galilee he saw two brothers Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishermen
And he said to them Follow me and I will make you fishers of men
Immediately they left their nets and followed him
And going on from there he saw two other brothers James the son of Zebedee and John his brother in the boat with Zebedee their father mending their nets and he called them
Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him
And he went throughout all Galilee teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction among the people
So his fame spread throughout all Syria and they brought him all the sick those afflicted with various diseases and pains those oppressed by demons epileptics and paralytics and he healed them
And great crowds followed him from Galilee and the Decapolis and from Jerusalem and Judea and from beyond the Jordan
