Luke 15
Now the tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to hear him
And the Pharisees and the scribes grumbled saying This man receives sinners and eats with them
So he told them this parable
What man of you having a hundred sheep if he has lost one of them does not leave the ninety nine in the open country and go after the one that is lost until he finds it
And when he has found it he lays it on his shoulders rejoicing
And when he comes home he calls together his friends and his neighbors saying to them Rejoice with me for I have found my sheep that was lost
Just so I tell you there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety nine righteous persons who need no repentance
Or what woman having ten silver coins if she loses one coin does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she finds it
And when she has found it she calls together her friends and neighbors saying Rejoice with me for I have found the coin that I had lost
Just so I tell you there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents
And he said There was a man who had two sons
And the younger of them said to his father Father give me the share of property that is coming to me And he divided his property between them
Not many days later the younger son gathered all he had and took a journey into a far country and there he squandered his property in reckless living
And when he had spent everything a severe famine arose in that country and he began to be in need
So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country who sent him into his fields to feed pigs
And he was longing to be fed with the pods that the pigs ate and no one gave him anything
But when he came to himself he said How many of my father s hired servants have more than enough bread but I perish here with hunger
I will arise and go to my father and I will say to him Father I have sinned against heaven and before you
I am no longer worthy to be called your son Treat me as one of your hired servants
And he arose and came to his father But while he was still a long way off his father saw him and felt compassion and ran and embraced him and kissed him
And the son said to him Father I have sinned against heaven and before you I am no longer worthy to be called your son
But the father said to his servants Bring quickly the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet
And bring the fattened calf and kill it and let us eat and celebrate
For this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found And they began to celebrate
Now his older son was in the field and as he came and drew near to the house he heard music and dancing
And he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant
And he said to him Your brother has come and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has received him back safe and sound
But he was angry and refused to go in His father came out and entreated him
but he answered his father Look these many years I have served you and I never disobeyed your command yet you never gave me a young goat that I might celebrate with my friends
But when this son of yours came who has devoured your property with prostitutes you killed the fattened calf for him
And he said to him Son you are always with me and all that is mine is yours
It was fitting to celebrate and be glad for this your brother was dead and is alive he was lost and is found
