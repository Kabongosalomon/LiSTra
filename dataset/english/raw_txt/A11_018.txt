1 Kings 18
After many days the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year saying Go show yourself to Ahab and I will send rain upon the earth
So Elijah went to show himself to Ahab Now the famine was severe in Samaria
And Ahab called Obadiah who was over the household Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly
and when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD Obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifties in a cave and fed them with bread and water
And Ahab said to Obadiah Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the valleys Perhaps we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive and not lose some of the animals
So they divided the land between them to pass through it Ahab went in one direction by himself and Obadiah went in another direction by himself
And as Obadiah was on the way behold Elijah met him And Obadiah recognized him and fell on his face and said Is it you my lord Elijah
And he answered him It is I Go tell your lord Behold Elijah is here
And he said How have I sinned that you would give your servant into the hand of Ahab to kill me
As the LORD your God lives there is no nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent to seek you And when they would say He is not here he would take an oath of the kingdom or nation that they had not found you
And now you say Go tell your lord Behold Elijah is here
And as soon as I have gone from you the Spirit of the LORD will carry you I know not where And so when I come and tell Ahab and he cannot find you he will kill me although I your servant have feared the LORD from my youth
Has it not been told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the LORD how I hid a hundred men of the LORD s prophets by fifties in a cave and fed them with bread and water
And now you say Go tell your lord Behold Elijah is here and he will kill me
And Elijah said As the LORD of hosts lives before whom I stand I will surely show myself to him today
So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him And Ahab went to meet Elijah
When Ahab saw Elijah Ahab said to him Is it you you troubler of Israel
And he answered I have not troubled Israel but you have and your father s house because you have abandoned the commandments of the LORD and followed the Baals
Now therefore send and gather all Israel to me at Mount Carmel and the prophets of Baal and the prophets of Asherah who eat at Jezebel s table
So Ahab sent to all the people of Israel and gathered the prophets together at Mount Carmel
And Elijah came near to all the people and said How long will you go limping between two different opinions If the LORD is God follow him but if Baal then follow him And the people did not answer him a word
Then Elijah said to the people I even I only am left a prophet of the LORD but Baal s prophets are men
Let two bulls be given to us and let them choose one bull for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood but put no fire to it And I will prepare the other bull and lay it on the wood and put no fire to it
And you call upon the name of your god and I will call upon the name of the LORD and the God who answers by fire he is God And all the people answered It is well spoken
Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal Choose for yourselves one bull and prepare it first for you are many and call upon the name of your god but put no fire to it
And they took the bull that was given them and they prepared it and called upon the name of Baal from morning until noon saying O Baal answer us But there was no voice and no one answered And they limped around the altar that they had made
And at noon Elijah mocked them saying Cry aloud for he is a god Either he is musing or he is relieving himself or he is on a journey or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened
And they cried aloud and cut themselves after their custom with swords and lances until the blood gushed out upon them
And as midday passed they raved on until the time of the offering of the oblation but there was no voice No one answered no one paid attention
Then Elijah said to all the people Come near to me And all the people came near to him And he repaired the altar of the LORD that had been thrown down
Elijah took twelve stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob to whom the word of the LORD came saying Israel shall be your name
and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD And he made a trench about the altar as great as would contain two seahs of seed
And he put the wood in order and cut the bull in pieces and laid it on the wood And he said Fill four jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood
And he said Do it a second time And they did it a second time And he said Do it a third time And they did it a third time
And the water ran around the altar and filled the trench also with water
And at the time of the offering of the oblation Elijah the prophet came near and said O LORD God of Abraham Isaac and Israel let it be known this day that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and that I have done all these things at your word
Answer me O LORD answer me that this people may know that you O LORD are God and that you have turned their hearts back
Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the burnt offering and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench
And when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and said The LORD he is God the LORD he is God
And Elijah said to them Seize the prophets of Baal let not one of them escape And they seized them And Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon and slaughtered them there
And Elijah said to Ahab Go up eat and drink for there is a sound of the rushing of rain
So Ahab went up to eat and to drink And Elijah went up to the top of Mount Carmel And he bowed himself down on the earth and put his face between his knees
And he said to his servant Go up now look toward the sea And he went up and looked and said There is nothing And he said Go again seven times
And at the seventh time he said Behold a little cloud like a man s hand is rising from the sea And he said Go up say to Ahab Prepare your chariot and go down lest the rain stop you
And in a little while the heavens grew black with clouds and wind and there was a great rain And Ahab rode and went to Jezreel
And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah and he gathered up his garment and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel
