Daniel 10
In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a word was revealed to Daniel who was named Belteshazzar And the word was true and it was a great conflict And he understood the word and had understanding of the vision
In those days I Daniel was mourning for three weeks
I ate no delicacies no meat or wine entered my mouth nor did I anoint myself at all for the full three weeks
On the twenty fourth day of the first month as I was standing on the bank of the great river that is the Tigris
I lifted up my eyes and looked and behold a man clothed in linen with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist
His body was like beryl his face like the appearance of lightning his eyes like flaming torches his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze and the sound of his words like the sound of a multitude
And I Daniel alone saw the vision for the men who were with me did not see the vision but a great trembling fell upon them and they fled to hide themselves
So I was left alone and saw this great vision and no strength was left in me My radiant appearance was fearfully changed and I retained no strength
Then I heard the sound of his words and as I heard the sound of his words I fell on my face in deep sleep with my face to the ground
And behold a hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees
And he said to me O Daniel man greatly loved understand the words that I speak to you and stand upright for now I have been sent to you And when he had spoken this word to me I stood up trembling
Then he said to me Fear not Daniel for from the first day that you set your heart to understand and humbled yourself before your God your words have been heard and I have come because of your words
The prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty one days but Michael one of the chief princes came to help me for I was left there with the kings of Persia
and came to make you understand what is to happen to your people in the latter days For the vision is for days yet to come
When he had spoken to me according to these words I turned my face toward the ground and was mute
And behold one in the likeness of the children of man touched my lips Then I opened my mouth and spoke I said to him who stood before me O my lord by reason of the vision pains have come upon me and I retain no strength
How can my lord s servant talk with my lord For now no strength remains in me and no breath is left in me
Again one having the appearance of a man touched me and strengthened me
And he said O man greatly loved fear not peace be with you be strong and of good courage And as he spoke to me I was strengthened and said Let my lord speak for you have strengthened me
Then he said Do you know why I have come to you But now I will return to fight against the prince of Persia and when I go out behold the prince of Greece will come
But I will tell you what is inscribed in the book of truth there is none who contends by my side against these except Michael your prince
