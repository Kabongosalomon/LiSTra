2 Samuel 20
Now there happened to be there a worthless man whose name was Sheba the son of Bichri a Benjaminite And he blew the trumpet and said We have no portion in David and we have no inheritance in the son of Jesse every man to his tents O Israel
So all the men of Israel withdrew from David and followed Sheba the son of Bichri But the men of Judah followed their king steadfastly from the Jordan to Jerusalem
And David came to his house at Jerusalem And the king took the ten concubines whom he had left to care for the house and put them in a house under guard and provided for them but did not go in to them So they were shut up until the day of their death living as if in widowhood
Then the king said to Amasa Call the men of Judah together to me within three days and be here yourself
So Amasa went to summon Judah but he delayed beyond the set time that had been appointed him
And David said to Abishai Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom Take your lord s servants and pursue him lest he get himself to fortified cities and escape from us
And there went out after him Joab s men and the Cherethites and the Pelethites and all the mighty men They went out from Jerusalem to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri
When they were at the great stone that is in Gibeon Amasa came to meet them Now Joab was wearing a soldier s garment and over it was a belt with a sword in its sheath fastened on his thigh and as he went forward it fell out
And Joab said to Amasa Is it well with you my brother And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him
But Amasa did not observe the sword that was in Joab s hand So Joab struck him with it in the stomach and spilled his entrails to the ground without striking a second blow and he died Then Joab and Abishai his brother pursued Sheba the son of Bichri
And one of Joab s young men took his stand by Amasa and said Whoever favors Joab and whoever is for David let him follow Joab
And Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the highway And anyone who came by seeing him stopped And when the man saw that all the people stopped he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field and threw a garment over him
When he was taken out of the highway all the people went on after Joab to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri
And Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel of Beth maacah and all the Bichrites assembled and followed him in
And all the men who were with Joab came and besieged him in Abel of Beth maacah They cast up a mound against the city and it stood against the rampart and they were battering the wall to throw it down
Then a wise woman called from the city Listen Listen Tell Joab Come here that I may speak to you
And he came near her and the woman said Are you Joab He answered I am Then she said to him Listen to the words of your servant And he answered I am listening
Then she said They used to say in former times Let them but ask counsel at Abel and so they settled a matter
I am one of those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel You seek to destroy a city that is a mother in Israel Why will you swallow up the heritage of the LORD
Joab answered Far be it from me far be it that I should swallow up or destroy
That is not true But a man of the hill country of Ephraim called Sheba the son of Bichri has lifted up his hand against King David Give up him alone and I will withdraw from the city And the woman said to Joab Behold his head shall be thrown to you over the wall
Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri and threw it out to Joab So he blew the trumpet and they dispersed from the city every man to his home And Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king
Now Joab was in command of all the army of Israel and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was in command of the Cherethites and the Pelethites
and Adoram was in charge of the forced labor and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder
and Sheva was secretary and Zadok and Abiathar were priests
and Ira the Jairite was also David s priest
