Jeremiah 47
The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines before Pharaoh struck down Gaza
Thus says the LORD Behold waters are rising out of the north and shall become an overflowing torrent they shall overflow the land and all that fills it the city and those who dwell in it Men shall cry out and every inhabitant of the land shall wail
At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his stallions at the rushing of his chariots at the rumbling of their wheels the fathers look not back to their children so feeble are their hands
because of the day that is coming to destroy all the Philistines to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper that remains For the LORD is destroying the Philistines the remnant of the coastland of Caphtor
Baldness has come upon Gaza Ashkelon has perished O remnant of their valley how long will you gash yourselves
Ah sword of the LORD How long till you are quiet Put yourself into your scabbard rest and be still
How can it be quiet when the LORD has given it a charge Against Ashkelon and against the seashore he has appointed it
