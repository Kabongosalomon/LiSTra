2 Thessalonians 2
Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together to him we ask you brothers
not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarmed either by a spirit or a spoken word or a letter seeming to be from us to the effect that the day of the Lord has come
Let no one deceive you in any way For that day will not come unless the rebellion comes first and the man of lawlessness is revealed the son of destruction
who opposes and exalts himself against every so called god or object of worship so that he takes his seat in the temple of God proclaiming himself to be God
Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things
And you know what is restraining him now so that he may be revealed in his time
For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work Only he who now restrains it will do so until he is out of the way
And then the lawless one will be revealed whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by the appearance of his coming
The coming of the lawless one is by the activity of Satan with all power and false signs and wonders
and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing because they refused to love the truth and so be saved
Therefore God sends them a strong delusion so that they may believe what is false
in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness
But we ought always to give thanks to God for you brothers beloved by the Lord because God chose you as the firstfruits to be saved through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth
To this he called you through our gospel so that you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ
So then brothers stand firm and hold to the traditions that you were taught by us either by our spoken word or by our letter
Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace
comfort your hearts and establish them in every good work and word
