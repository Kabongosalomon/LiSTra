Song of Solomon 5
I came to my garden my sister my bride I gathered my myrrh with my spice I ate my honeycomb with my honey I drank my wine with my milk OTHERS Eat friends drink and be drunk with love SHE
I slept but my heart was awake A sound My beloved is knocking Open to me my sister my love my dove my perfect one for my head is wet with dew my locks with the drops of the night
I had put off my garment how could I put it on I had bathed my feet how could I soil them
My beloved put his hand to the latch and my heart was thrilled within me
I arose to open to my beloved and my hands dripped with myrrh my fingers with liquid myrrh on the handles of the bolt
I opened to my beloved but my beloved had turned and gone My soul failed me when he spoke I sought him but found him not I called him but he gave no answer
The watchmen found me as they went about in the city they beat me they bruised me they took away my veil those watchmen of the walls
I adjure you O daughters of Jerusalem if you find my beloved that you tell him I am sick with love OTHERS
What is your beloved more than another beloved O most beautiful among women What is your beloved more than another beloved that you thus adjure us SHE
My beloved is radiant and ruddy distinguished among ten thousand
His head is the finest gold his locks are wavy black as a raven
His eyes are like doves beside streams of water bathed in milk sitting beside a full pool
His cheeks are like beds of spices mounds of sweet smelling herbs His lips are lilies dripping liquid myrrh
His arms are rods of gold set with jewels His body is polished ivory bedecked with sapphires
His legs are alabaster columns set on bases of gold His appearance is like Lebanon choice as the cedars
His mouth is most sweet and he is altogether desirable This is my beloved and this is my friend O daughters of Jerusalem
