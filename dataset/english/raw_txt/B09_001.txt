Galathians 1
Paul an apostle not from men nor through man but through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead
and all the brothers who are with me To the churches of Galatia
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
who gave himself for our sins to deliver us from the present evil age according to the will of our God and Father
to whom be the glory forever and ever Amen
I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel
not that there is another one but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ
But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you let him be accursed
As we have said before so now I say again If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received let him be accursed
For am I now seeking the approval of man or of God Or am I trying to please man If I were still trying to please man I would not be a servant of Christ
For I would have you know brothers that the gospel that was preached by me is not man s gospel
For I did not receive it from any man nor was I taught it but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ
For you have heard of my former life in Judaism how I persecuted the church of God violently and tried to destroy it
And I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people so extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers
But when he who had set me apart before I was born and who called me by his grace
was pleased to reveal his Son to me in order that I might preach him among the Gentiles I did not immediately consult with anyone
nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me but I went away into Arabia and returned again to Damascus
Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and remained with him fifteen days
But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord s brother
In what I am writing to you before God I do not lie
Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia
And I was still unknown in person to the churches of Judea that are in Christ
They only were hearing it said He who used to persecute us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy
And they glorified God because of me
