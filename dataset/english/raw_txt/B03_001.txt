Luke 1
Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the things that have been accomplished among us
just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word have delivered them to us
it seemed good to me also having followed all things closely for some time past to write an orderly account for you most excellent Theophilus
that you may have certainty concerning the things you have been taught
In the days of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah of the division of Abijah And he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron and her name was Elizabeth
And they were both righteous before God walking blamelessly in all the commandments and statutes of the Lord
But they had no child because Elizabeth was barren and both were advanced in years
Now while he was serving as priest before God when his division was on duty
according to the custom of the priesthood he was chosen by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense
And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense
And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense
And Zechariah was troubled when he saw him and fear fell upon him
But the angel said to him Do not be afraid Zechariah for your prayer has been heard and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son and you shall call his name John
And you will have joy and gladness and many will rejoice at his birth
for he will be great before the Lord And he must not drink wine or strong drink and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother s womb
And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God
and he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready for the Lord a people prepared
And Zechariah said to the angel How shall I know this For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years
And the angel answered him I am Gabriel I stand in the presence of God and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news
And behold you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things take place because you did not believe my words which will be fulfilled in their time
And the people were waiting for Zechariah and they were wondering at his delay in the temple
And when he came out he was unable to speak to them and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple And he kept making signs to them and remained mute
And when his time of service was ended he went to his home
After these days his wife Elizabeth conceived and for five months she kept herself hidden saying
Thus the Lord has done for me in the days when he looked on me to take away my reproach among people
In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth
to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph of the house of David And the virgin s name was Mary
And he came to her and said Greetings O favored one the Lord is with you
But she was greatly troubled at the saying and tried to discern what sort of greeting this might be
And the angel said to her Do not be afraid Mary for you have found favor with God
And behold you will conceive in your womb and bear a son and you shall call his name Jesus
He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David
and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there will be no end
And Mary said to the angel How will this be since I am a virgin
And the angel answered her The Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the Most High will overshadow you therefore the child to be born will be called holy the Son of God
And behold your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren
For nothing will be impossible with God
And Mary said Behold I am the servant of the Lord let it be to me according to your word And the angel departed from her
In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country to a town in Judah
and she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth
And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary the baby leaped in her womb And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit
and she exclaimed with a loud cry Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb
And why is this granted to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me
For behold when the sound of your greeting came to my ears the baby in my womb leaped for joy
And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord
And Mary said My soul magnifies the Lord
and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior
for he has looked on the humble estate of his servant For behold from now on all generations will call me blessed
for he who is mighty has done great things for me and holy is his name
And his mercy is for those who fear him from generation to generation
He has shown strength with his arm he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts
he has brought down the mighty from their thrones and exalted those of humble estate
he has filled the hungry with good things and the rich he has sent away empty
He has helped his servant Israel in remembrance of his mercy
as he spoke to our fathers to Abraham and to his offspring forever
And Mary remained with her about three months and returned to her home
Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth and she bore a son
And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her and they rejoiced with her
And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child And they would have called him Zechariah after his father
but his mother answered No he shall be called John
And they said to her None of your relatives is called by this name
And they made signs to his father inquiring what he wanted him to be called
And he asked for a writing tablet and wrote His name is John And they all wondered
And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed and he spoke blessing God
And fear came on all their neighbors And all these things were talked about through all the hill country of Judea
and all who heard them laid them up in their hearts saying What then will this child be For the hand of the Lord was with him
And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied saying
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel for he has visited and redeemed his people
and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David
as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old
that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us
to show the mercy promised to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant
the oath that he swore to our father Abraham to grant us
that we being delivered from the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear
in holiness and righteousness before him all our days
And you child will be called the prophet of the Most High for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways
to give knowledge of salvation to his people in the forgiveness of their sins
because of the tender mercy of our God whereby the sunrise shall visit us from on high
to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death to guide our feet into the way of peace
And the child grew and became strong in spirit and he was in the wilderness until the day of his public appearance to Israel
