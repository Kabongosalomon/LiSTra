Micah 3
And I said Hear you heads of Jacob and rulers of the house of Israel Is it not for you to know justice
you who hate the good and love the evil who tear the skin from off my people and their flesh from off their bones
who eat the flesh of my people and flay their skin from off them and break their bones in pieces and chop them up like meat in a pot like flesh in a cauldron
Then they will cry to the LORD but he will not answer them he will hide his face from them at that time because they have made their deeds evil
Thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who lead my people astray who cry Peace when they have something to eat but declare war against him who puts nothing into their mouths
Therefore it shall be night to you without vision and darkness to you without divination The sun shall go down on the prophets and the day shall be black over them
the seers shall be disgraced and the diviners put to shame they shall all cover their lips for there is no answer from God
But as for me I am filled with power with the Spirit of the LORD and with justice and might to declare to Jacob his transgression and to Israel his sin
Hear this you heads of the house of Jacob and rulers of the house of Israel who detest justice and make crooked all that is straight
who build Zion with blood and Jerusalem with iniquity
Its heads give judgment for a bribe its priests teach for a price its prophets practice divination for money yet they lean on the LORD and say Is not the LORD in the midst of us No disaster shall come upon us
Therefore because of you Zion shall be plowed as a field Jerusalem shall become a heap of ruins and the mountain of the house a wooded height
