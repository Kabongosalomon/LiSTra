John 4
Now when Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John
although Jesus himself did not baptize but only his disciples
he left Judea and departed again for Galilee
And he had to pass through Samaria
So he came to a town of Samaria called Sychar near the field that Jacob had given to his son Joseph
Jacob s well was there so Jesus wearied as he was from his journey was sitting beside the well It was about the sixth hour
A woman from Samaria came to draw water Jesus said to her Give me a drink
For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food
The Samaritan woman said to him How is it that you a Jew ask for a drink from me a woman of Samaria For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans
Jesus answered her If you knew the gift of God and who it is that is saying to you Give me a drink you would have asked him and he would have given you living water
The woman said to him Sir you have nothing to draw water with and the well is deep Where do you get that living water
Are you greater than our father Jacob He gave us the well and drank from it himself as did his sons and his livestock
Jesus said to her Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again
but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life
The woman said to him Sir give me this water so that I will not be thirsty or have to come here to draw water
Jesus said to her Go call your husband and come here
The woman answered him I have no husband Jesus said to her You are right in saying I have no husband
for you have had five husbands and the one you now have is not your husband What you have said is true
The woman said to him Sir I perceive that you are a prophet
Our fathers worshiped on this mountain but you say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship
Jesus said to her Woman believe me the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father
You worship what you do not know we worship what we know for salvation is from the Jews
But the hour is coming and is now here when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth for the Father is seeking such people to worship him
God is spirit and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth
The woman said to him I know that Messiah is coming he who is called Christ When he comes he will tell us all things
Jesus said to her I who speak to you am he
Just then his disciples came back They marveled that he was talking with a woman but no one said What do you seek or Why are you talking with her
So the woman left her water jar and went away into town and said to the people
Come see a man who told me all that I ever did Can this be the Christ
They went out of the town and were coming to him
Meanwhile the disciples were urging him saying Rabbi eat
But he said to them I have food to eat that you do not know about
So the disciples said to one another Has anyone brought him something to eat
Jesus said to them My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to accomplish his work
Do you not say There are yet four months then comes the harvest Look I tell you lift up your eyes and see that the fields are white for harvest
Already the one who reaps is receiving wages and gathering fruit for eternal life so that sower and reaper may rejoice together
For here the saying holds true One sows and another reaps
I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor Others have labored and you have entered into their labor
Many Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman s testimony He told me all that I ever did
So when the Samaritans came to him they asked him to stay with them and he stayed there two days
And many more believed because of his word
They said to the woman It is no longer because of what you said that we believe for we have heard for ourselves and we know that this is indeed the Savior of the world
After the two days he departed for Galilee
For Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own hometown
So when he came to Galilee the Galileans welcomed him having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast For they too had gone to the feast
So he came again to Cana in Galilee where he had made the water wine And at Capernaum there was an official whose son was ill
When this man heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee he went to him and asked him to come down and heal his son for he was at the point of death
So Jesus said to him Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe
The official said to him Sir come down before my child dies
Jesus said to him Go your son will live The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went on his way
As he was going down his servants met him and told him that his son was recovering
So he asked them the hour when he began to get better and they said to him Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him
The father knew that was the hour when Jesus had said to him Your son will live And he himself believed and all his household
This was now the second sign that Jesus did when he had come from Judea to Galilee
