Romans 12
I appeal to you therefore brothers by the mercies of God to present your bodies as a living sacrifice holy and acceptable to God which is your spiritual worship
Do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewal of your mind that by testing you may discern what is the will of God what is good and acceptable and perfect
For by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think with sober judgment each according to the measure of faith that God has assigned
For as in one body we have many members and the members do not all have the same function
so we though many are one body in Christ and individually members one of another
Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us let us use them if prophecy in proportion to our faith
if service in our serving the one who teaches in his teaching
the one who exhorts in his exhortation the one who contributes in generosity the one who leads with zeal the one who does acts of mercy with cheerfulness
Let love be genuine Abhor what is evil hold fast to what is good
Love one another with brotherly affection Outdo one another in showing honor
Do not be slothful in zeal be fervent in spirit serve the Lord
Rejoice in hope be patient in tribulation be constant in prayer
Contribute to the needs of the saints and seek to show hospitality
Bless those who persecute you bless and do not curse them
Rejoice with those who rejoice weep with those who weep
Live in harmony with one another Do not be haughty but associate with the lowly Never be wise in your own sight
Repay no one evil for evil but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all
If possible so far as it depends on you live peaceably with all
Beloved never avenge yourselves but leave it to the wrath of God for it is written Vengeance is mine I will repay says the Lord
To the contrary if your enemy is hungry feed him if he is thirsty give him something to drink for by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head
Do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good
