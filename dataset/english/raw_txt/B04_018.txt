John 18
When Jesus had spoken these words he went out with his disciples across the Kidron Valley where there was a garden which he and his disciples entered
Now Judas who betrayed him also knew the place for Jesus often met there with his disciples
So Judas having procured a band of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees went there with lanterns and torches and weapons
Then Jesus knowing all that would happen to him came forward and said to them Whom do you seek
They answered him Jesus of Nazareth Jesus said to them I am he Judas who betrayed him was standing with them
When Jesus said to them I am he they drew back and fell to the ground
So he asked them again Whom do you seek And they said Jesus of Nazareth
Jesus answered I told you that I am he So if you seek me let these men go
This was to fulfill the word that he had spoken Of those whom you gave me I have lost not one
Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it and struck the high priest s servant and cut off his right ear The servant s name was Malchus
So Jesus said to Peter Put your sword into its sheath shall I not drink the cup that the Father has given me
So the band of soldiers and their captain and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound him
First they led him to Annas for he was the father in law of Caiaphas who was high priest that year
It was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it would be expedient that one man should die for the people
Simon Peter followed Jesus and so did another disciple Since that disciple was known to the high priest he entered with Jesus into the court of the high priest
but Peter stood outside at the door So the other disciple who was known to the high priest went out and spoke to the servant girl who kept watch at the door and brought Peter in
The servant girl at the door said to Peter You also are not one of this man s disciples are you He said I am not
Now the servants and officers had made a charcoal fire because it was cold and they were standing and warming themselves Peter also was with them standing and warming himself
The high priest then questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching
Jesus answered him I have spoken openly to the world I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple where all Jews come together I have said nothing in secret
Why do you ask me Ask those who have heard me what I said to them they know what I said
When he had said these things one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand saying Is that how you answer the high priest
Jesus answered him If what I said is wrong bear witness about the wrong but if what I said is right why do you strike me
Annas then sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest
Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself So they said to him You also are not one of his disciples are you He denied it and said I am not
One of the servants of the high priest a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off asked Did I not see you in the garden with him
Peter again denied it and at once a rooster crowed
Then they led Jesus from the house of Caiaphas to the governor s headquarters It was early morning They themselves did not enter the governor s headquarters so that they would not be defiled but could eat the Passover
So Pilate went outside to them and said What accusation do you bring against this man
They answered him If this man were not doing evil we would not have delivered him over to you
Pilate said to them Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law The Jews said to him It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death
This was to fulfill the word that Jesus had spoken to show by what kind of death he was going to die
So Pilate entered his headquarters again and called Jesus and said to him Are you the King of the Jews
Jesus answered Do you say this of your own accord or did others say it to you about me
Pilate answered Am I a Jew Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered you over to me What have you done
Jesus answered My kingdom is not of this world If my kingdom were of this world my servants would have been fighting that I might not be delivered over to the Jews But my kingdom is not from the world
Then Pilate said to him So you are a king Jesus answered You say that I am a king For this purpose I was born and for this purpose I have come into the world to bear witness to the truth Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice
Pilate said to him What is truth After he had said this he went back outside to the Jews and told them I find no guilt in him
But you have a custom that I should release one man for you at the Passover So do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews
They cried out again Not this man but Barabbas Now Barabbas was a robber
