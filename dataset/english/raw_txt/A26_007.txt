Ezekiel 7
The word of the LORD came to me
And you O son of man thus says the Lord GOD to the land of Israel An end The end has come upon the four corners of the land
Now the end is upon you and I will send my anger upon you I will judge you according to your ways and I will punish you for all your abominations
And my eye will not spare you nor will I have pity but I will punish you for your ways while your abominations are in your midst Then you will know that I am the LORD
Thus says the Lord GOD Disaster after disaster Behold it comes
An end has come the end has come it has awakened against you Behold it comes
Your doom has come to you O inhabitant of the land The time has come the day is near a day of tumult and not of joyful shouting on the mountains
Now I will soon pour out my wrath upon you and spend my anger against you and judge you according to your ways and I will punish you for all your abominations
And my eye will not spare nor will I have pity I will punish you according to your ways while your abominations are in your midst Then you will know that I am the LORD who strikes
Behold the day Behold it comes Your doom has come the rod has blossomed pride has budded
Violence has grown up into a rod of wickedness None of them shall remain nor their abundance nor their wealth neither shall there be preeminence among them
The time has come the day has arrived Let not the buyer rejoice nor the seller mourn for wrath is upon all their multitude
For the seller shall not return to what he has sold while they live For the vision concerns all their multitude it shall not turn back and because of his iniquity none can maintain his life
They have blown the trumpet and made everything ready but none goes to battle for my wrath is upon all their multitude
The sword is without pestilence and famine are within He who is in the field dies by the sword and him who is in the city famine and pestilence devour
And if any survivors escape they will be on the mountains like doves of the valleys all of them moaning each one over his iniquity
All hands are feeble and all knees turn to water
They put on sackcloth and horror covers them Shame is on all faces and baldness on all their heads
They cast their silver into the streets and their gold is like an unclean thing Their silver and gold are not able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD They cannot satisfy their hunger or fill their stomachs with it For it was the stumbling block of their iniquity
His beautiful ornament they used for pride and they made their abominable images and their detestable things of it Therefore I make it an unclean thing to them
And I will give it into the hands of foreigners for prey and to the wicked of the earth for spoil and they shall profane it
I will turn my face from them and they shall profane my treasured place Robbers shall enter and profane it
Forge a chain For the land is full of bloody crimes and the city is full of violence
I will bring the worst of the nations to take possession of their houses I will put an end to the pride of the strong and their holy places shall be profaned
When anguish comes they will seek peace but there shall be none
Disaster comes upon disaster rumor follows rumor They seek a vision from the prophet while the law perishes from the priest and counsel from the elders
The king mourns the prince is wrapped in despair and the hands of the people of the land are paralyzed by terror According to their way I will do to them and according to their judgments I will judge them and they shall know that I am the LORD
