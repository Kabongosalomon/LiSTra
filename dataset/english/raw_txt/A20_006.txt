Proverbs 6
My son if you have put up security for your neighbor have given your pledge for a stranger
if you are snared in the words of your mouth caught in the words of your mouth
then do this my son and save yourself for you have come into the hand of your neighbor go hasten and plead urgently with your neighbor
Give your eyes no sleep and your eyelids no slumber
save yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter like a bird from the hand of the fowler
Go to the ant O sluggard consider her ways and be wise
Without having any chief officer or ruler
she prepares her bread in summer and gathers her food in harvest
How long will you lie there O sluggard When will you arise from your sleep
A little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to rest
and poverty will come upon you like a robber and want like an armed man
A worthless person a wicked man goes about with crooked speech
winks with his eyes signals with his feet points with his finger
with perverted heart devises evil continually sowing discord
therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly in a moment he will be broken beyond healing
There are six things that the LORD hates seven that are an abomination to him
haughty eyes a lying tongue and hands that shed innocent blood
a heart that devises wicked plans feet that make haste to run to evil
a false witness who breathes out lies and one who sows discord among brothers
My son keep your father s commandment and forsake not your mother s teaching
Bind them on your heart always tie them around your neck
When you walk they will lead you when you lie down they will watch over you and when you awake they will talk with you
For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching a light and the reproofs of discipline are the way of life
to preserve you from the evil woman from the smooth tongue of the adulteress
Do not desire her beauty in your heart and do not let her capture you with her eyelashes
for the price of a prostitute is only a loaf of bread but a married woman hunts down a precious life
Can a man carry fire next to his chest and his clothes not be burned
Or can one walk on hot coals and his feet not be scorched
So is he who goes in to his neighbor s wife none who touches her will go unpunished
People do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his appetite when he is hungry
but if he is caught he will pay sevenfold he will give all the goods of his house
He who commits adultery lacks sense he who does it destroys himself
He will get wounds and dishonor and his disgrace will not be wiped away
For jealousy makes a man furious and he will not spare when he takes revenge
He will accept no compensation he will refuse though you multiply gifts
