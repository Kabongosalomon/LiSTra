Hosea 14
Return O Israel to the LORD your God for you have stumbled because of your iniquity
Take with you words and return to the LORD say to him Take away all iniquity accept what is good and we will pay with bulls the vows of our lips
Assyria shall not save us we will not ride on horses and we will say no more Our God to the work of our hands In you the orphan finds mercy
I will heal their apostasy I will love them freely for my anger has turned from them
I will be like the dew to Israel he shall blossom like the lily he shall take root like the trees of Lebanon
his shoots shall spread out his beauty shall be like the olive and his fragrance like Lebanon
They shall return and dwell beneath my shadow they shall flourish like the grain they shall blossom like the vine their fame shall be like the wine of Lebanon
O Ephraim what have I to do with idols It is I who answer and look after you I am like an evergreen cypress from me comes your fruit
Whoever is wise let him understand these things whoever is discerning let him know them for the ways of the LORD are right and the upright walk in them but transgressors stumble in them
