Numbers 22
Then the people of Israel set out and camped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho
And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites
And Moab was in great dread of the people because they were many Moab was overcome with fear of the people of Israel
And Moab said to the elders of Midian This horde will now lick up all that is around us as the ox licks up the grass of the field So Balak the son of Zippor who was king of Moab at that time
sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor at Pethor which is near the River in the land of the people of Amaw to call him saying Behold a people has come out of Egypt They cover the face of the earth and they are dwelling opposite me
Come now curse this people for me since they are too mighty for me Perhaps I shall be able to defeat them and drive them from the land for I know that he whom you bless is blessed and he whom you curse is cursed
So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the fees for divination in their hand And they came to Balaam and gave him Balak s message
And he said to them Lodge here tonight and I will bring back word to you as the LORD speaks to me So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam
And God came to Balaam and said Who are these men with you
And Balaam said to God Balak the son of Zippor king of Moab has sent to me saying
Behold a people has come out of Egypt and it covers the face of the earth Now come curse them for me Perhaps I shall be able to fight against them and drive them out
God said to Balaam You shall not go with them You shall not curse the people for they are blessed
So Balaam rose in the morning and said to the princes of Balak Go to your own land for the LORD has refused to let me go with you
So the princes of Moab rose and went to Balak and said Balaam refuses to come with us
Once again Balak sent princes more in number and more honorable than these
And they came to Balaam and said to him Thus says Balak the son of Zippor Let nothing hinder you from coming to me
for I will surely do you great honor and whatever you say to me I will do Come curse this people for me
But Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold I could not go beyond the command of the LORD my God to do less or more
So you too please stay here tonight that I may know what more the LORD will say to me
And God came to Balaam at night and said to him If the men have come to call you rise go with them but only do what I tell you
So Balaam rose in the morning and saddled his donkey and went with the princes of Moab
But God s anger was kindled because he went and the angel of the LORD took his stand in the way as his adversary Now he was riding on the donkey and his two servants were with him
And the donkey saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand And the donkey turned aside out of the road and went into the field And Balaam struck the donkey to turn her into the road
Then the angel of the LORD stood in a narrow path between the vineyards with a wall on either side
And when the donkey saw the angel of the LORD she pushed against the wall and pressed Balaam s foot against the wall So he struck her again
Then the angel of the LORD went ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no way to turn either to the right or to the left
When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD she lay down under Balaam And Balaam s anger was kindled and he struck the donkey with his staff
Then the LORD opened the mouth of the donkey and she said to Balaam What have I done to you that you have struck me these three times
And Balaam said to the donkey Because you have made a fool of me I wish I had a sword in my hand for then I would kill you
And the donkey said to Balaam Am I not your donkey on which you have ridden all your life long to this day Is it my habit to treat you this way And he said No
Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way with his drawn sword in his hand And he bowed down and fell on his face
And the angel of the LORD said to him Why have you struck your donkey these three times Behold I have come out to oppose you because your way is perverse before me
The donkey saw me and turned aside before me these three times If she had not turned aside from me surely just now I would have killed you and let her live
Then Balaam said to the angel of the LORD I have sinned for I did not know that you stood in the road against me Now therefore if it is evil in your sight I will turn back
And the angel of the LORD said to Balaam Go with the men but speak only the word that I tell you So Balaam went on with the princes of Balak
When Balak heard that Balaam had come he went out to meet him at the city of Moab on the border formed by the Arnon at the extremity of the border
And Balak said to Balaam Did I not send to you to call you Why did you not come to me Am I not able to honor you
Balaam said to Balak Behold I have come to you Have I now any power of my own to speak anything The word that God puts in my mouth that must I speak
Then Balaam went with Balak and they came to Kiriath huzoth
And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep and sent for Balaam and for the princes who were with him
And in the morning Balak took Balaam and brought him up to Bamoth baal and from there he saw a fraction of the people
