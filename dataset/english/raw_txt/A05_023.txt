Deuteronomy 23
No one whose testicles are crushed or whose male organ is cut off shall enter the assembly of the LORD
No one born of a forbidden union may enter the assembly of the LORD Even to the tenth generation none of his descendants may enter the assembly of the LORD
No Ammonite or Moabite may enter the assembly of the LORD Even to the tenth generation none of them may enter the assembly of the LORD forever
because they did not meet you with bread and with water on the way when you came out of Egypt and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia to curse you
But the LORD your God would not listen to Balaam instead the LORD your God turned the curse into a blessing for you because the LORD your God loved you
You shall not seek their peace or their prosperity all your days forever
You shall not abhor an Edomite for he is your brother You shall not abhor an Egyptian because you were a sojourner in his land
Children born to them in the third generation may enter the assembly of the LORD
When you are encamped against your enemies then you shall keep yourself from every evil thing
If any man among you becomes unclean because of a nocturnal emission then he shall go outside the camp He shall not come inside the camp
but when evening comes he shall bathe himself in water and as the sun sets he may come inside the camp
You shall have a place outside the camp and you shall go out to it
And you shall have a trowel with your tools and when you sit down outside you shall dig a hole with it and turn back and cover up your excrement
Because the LORD your God walks in the midst of your camp to deliver you and to give up your enemies before you therefore your camp must be holy so that he may not see anything indecent among you and turn away from you
You shall not give up to his master a slave who has escaped from his master to you
He shall dwell with you in your midst in the place that he shall choose within one of your towns wherever it suits him You shall not wrong him
None of the daughters of Israel shall be a cult prostitute and none of the sons of Israel shall be a cult prostitute
You shall not bring the fee of a prostitute or the wages of a dog into the house of the LORD your God in payment for any vow for both of these are an abomination to the LORD your God
You shall not charge interest on loans to your brother interest on money interest on food interest on anything that is lent for interest
You may charge a foreigner interest but you may not charge your brother interest that the LORD your God may bless you in all that you undertake in the land that you are entering to take possession of it
If you make a vow to the LORD your God you shall not delay fulfilling it for the LORD your God will surely require it of you and you will be guilty of sin
But if you refrain from vowing you will not be guilty of sin
You shall be careful to do what has passed your lips for you have voluntarily vowed to the LORD your God what you have promised with your mouth
If you go into your neighbor s vineyard you may eat your fill of grapes as many as you wish but you shall not put any in your bag
If you go into your neighbor s standing grain you may pluck the ears with your hand but you shall not put a sickle to your neighbor s standing grain
