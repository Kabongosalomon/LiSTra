Job 22
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said
Can a man be profitable to God Surely he who is wise is profitable to himself
Is it any pleasure to the Almighty if you are in the right or is it gain to him if you make your ways blameless
Is it for your fear of him that he reproves you and enters into judgment with you
Is not your evil abundant There is no end to your iniquities
For you have exacted pledges of your brothers for nothing and stripped the naked of their clothing
You have given no water to the weary to drink and you have withheld bread from the hungry
The man with power possessed the land and the favored man lived in it
You have sent widows away empty and the arms of the fatherless were crushed
Therefore snares are all around you and sudden terror overwhelms you
or darkness so that you cannot see and a flood of water covers you
Is not God high in the heavens See the highest stars how lofty they are
But you say What does God know Can he judge through the deep darkness
Thick clouds veil him so that he does not see and he walks on the vault of heaven
Will you keep to the old way that wicked men have trod
They were snatched away before their time their foundation was washed away
They said to God Depart from us and What can the Almighty do to us
Yet he filled their houses with good things but the counsel of the wicked is far from me
The righteous see it and are glad the innocent one mocks at them
saying Surely our adversaries are cut off and what they left the fire has consumed
Agree with God and be at peace thereby good will come to you
Receive instruction from his mouth and lay up his words in your heart
If you return to the Almighty you will be built up if you remove injustice far from your tents
if you lay gold in the dust and gold of Ophir among the stones of the torrent bed
then the Almighty will be your gold and your precious silver
For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty and lift up your face to God
You will make your prayer to him and he will hear you and you will pay your vows
You will decide on a matter and it will be established for you and light will shine on your ways
For when they are humbled you say It is because of pride but he saves the lowly
He delivers even the one who is not innocent who will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands
