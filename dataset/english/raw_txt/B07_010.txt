1 Corienthians 10
For I want you to know brothers that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea
and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea
and all ate the same spiritual food
and all drank the same spiritual drink For they drank from the spiritual Rock that followed them and the Rock was Christ
Nevertheless with most of them God was not pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness
Now these things took place as examples for us that we might not desire evil as they did
Do not be idolaters as some of them were as it is written The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play
We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did and twenty three thousand fell in a single day
We must not put Christ to the test as some of them did and were destroyed by serpents
nor grumble as some of them did and were destroyed by the Destroyer
Now these things happened to them as an example but they were written down for our instruction on whom the end of the ages has come
Therefore let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall
No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man God is faithful and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape that you may be able to endure it
Therefore my beloved flee from idolatry
I speak as to sensible people judge for yourselves what I say
The cup of blessing that we bless is it not a participation in the blood of Christ The bread that we break is it not a participation in the body of Christ
Because there is one bread we who are many are one body for we all partake of the one bread
Consider the people of Israel are not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar
What do I imply then That food offered to idols is anything or that an idol is anything
No I imply that what pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God I do not want you to be participants with demons
You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons
Shall we provoke the Lord to jealousy Are we stronger than he
All things are lawful but not all things are helpful All things are lawful but not all things build up
Let no one seek his own good but the good of his neighbor
Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any question on the ground of conscience
For the earth is the Lord s and the fullness thereof
If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner and you are disposed to go eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience
But if someone says to you This has been offered in sacrifice then do not eat it for the sake of the one who informed you and for the sake of conscience
I do not mean your conscience but his For why should my liberty be determined by someone else s conscience
If I partake with thankfulness why am I denounced because of that for which I give thanks
So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do do all to the glory of God
Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God
just as I try to please everyone in everything I do not seeking my own advantage but that of many that they may be saved
