Leviticus 24
The LORD spoke to Moses saying
Command the people of Israel to bring you pure oil from beaten olives for the lamp that a light may be kept burning regularly
Outside the veil of the testimony in the tent of meeting Aaron shall arrange it from evening to morning before the LORD regularly It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations
He shall arrange the lamps on the lampstand of pure gold before the LORD regularly
You shall take fine flour and bake twelve loaves from it two tenths of an ephah shall be in each loaf
And you shall set them in two piles six in a pile on the table of pure gold before the LORD
And you shall put pure frankincense on each pile that it may go with the bread as a memorial portion as a food offering to the LORD
Every Sabbath day Aaron shall arrange it before the LORD regularly it is from the people of Israel as a covenant forever
And it shall be for Aaron and his sons and they shall eat it in a holy place since it is for him a most holy portion out of the LORD s food offerings a perpetual due
Now an Israelite woman s son whose father was an Egyptian went out among the people of Israel And the Israelite woman s son and a man of Israel fought in the camp
and the Israelite woman s son blasphemed the Name and cursed Then they brought him to Moses His mother s name was Shelomith the daughter of Dibri of the tribe of Dan
And they put him in custody till the will of the LORD should be clear to them
Then the LORD spoke to Moses saying
Bring out of the camp the one who cursed and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head and let all the congregation stone him
And speak to the people of Israel saying Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin
Whoever blasphemes the name of the LORD shall surely be put to death All the congregation shall stone him The sojourner as well as the native when he blasphemes the Name shall be put to death
Whoever takes a human life shall surely be put to death
Whoever takes an animal s life shall make it good life for life
If anyone injures his neighbor as he has done it shall be done to him
fracture for fracture eye for eye tooth for tooth whatever injury he has given a person shall be given to him
Whoever kills an animal shall make it good and whoever kills a person shall be put to death
You shall have the same rule for the sojourner and for the native for I am the LORD your God
So Moses spoke to the people of Israel and they brought out of the camp the one who had cursed and stoned him with stones Thus the people of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses
