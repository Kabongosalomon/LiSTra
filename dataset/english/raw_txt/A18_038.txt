Job 38
Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said
Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge
Dress for action like a man I will question you and you make it known to me
Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth Tell me if you have understanding
Who determined its measurements surely you know Or who stretched the line upon it
On what were its bases sunk or who laid its cornerstone
when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy
Or who shut in the sea with doors when it burst out from the womb
when I made clouds its garment and thick darkness its swaddling band
and prescribed limits for it and set bars and doors
and said Thus far shall you come and no farther and here shall your proud waves be stayed
Have you commanded the morning since your days began and caused the dawn to know its place
that it might take hold of the skirts of the earth and the wicked be shaken out of it
It is changed like clay under the seal and its features stand out like a garment
From the wicked their light is withheld and their uplifted arm is broken
Have you entered into the springs of the sea or walked in the recesses of the deep
Have the gates of death been revealed to you or have you seen the gates of deep darkness
Have you comprehended the expanse of the earth Declare if you know all this
Where is the way to the dwelling of light and where is the place of darkness
that you may take it to its territory and that you may discern the paths to its home
You know for you were born then and the number of your days is great
Have you entered the storehouses of the snow or have you seen the storehouses of the hail
which I have reserved for the time of trouble for the day of battle and war
What is the way to the place where the light is distributed or where the east wind is scattered upon the earth
Who has cleft a channel for the torrents of rain and a way for the thunderbolt
to bring rain on a land where no man is on the desert in which there is no man
to satisfy the waste and desolate land and to make the ground sprout with grass
Has the rain a father or who has begotten the drops of dew
From whose womb did the ice come forth and who has given birth to the frost of heaven
The waters become hard like stone and the face of the deep is frozen
Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades or loose the cords of Orion
Can you lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season or can you guide the Bear with its children
Do you know the ordinances of the heavens Can you establish their rule on the earth
Can you lift up your voice to the clouds that a flood of waters may cover you
Can you send forth lightnings that they may go and say to you Here we are
Who has put wisdom in the inward parts or given understanding to the mind
Who can number the clouds by wisdom Or who can tilt the waterskins of the heavens
when the dust runs into a mass and the clods stick fast together
Can you hunt the prey for the lion or satisfy the appetite of the young lions
when they crouch in their dens or lie in wait in their thicket
Who provides for the raven its prey when its young ones cry to God for help and wander about for lack of food
