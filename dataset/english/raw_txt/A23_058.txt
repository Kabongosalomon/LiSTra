Isaiah 58
Cry aloud do not hold back lift up your voice like a trumpet declare to my people their transgression to the house of Jacob their sins
Yet they seek me daily and delight to know my ways as if they were a nation that did righteousness and did not forsake the judgment of their God they ask of me righteous judgments they delight to draw near to God
Why have we fasted and you see it not Why have we humbled ourselves and you take no knowledge of it Behold in the day of your fast you seek your own pleasure and oppress all your workers
Behold you fast only to quarrel and to fight and to hit with a wicked fist Fasting like yours this day will not make your voice to be heard on high
Is such the fast that I choose a day for a person to humble himself Is it to bow down his head like a reed and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him Will you call this a fast and a day acceptable to the LORD
Is not this the fast that I choose to loose the bonds of wickedness to undo the straps of the yoke to let the oppressed go free and to break every yoke
Is it not to share your bread with the hungry and bring the homeless poor into your house when you see the naked to cover him and not to hide yourself from your own flesh
Then shall your light break forth like the dawn and your healing shall spring up speedily your righteousness shall go before you the glory of the LORD shall be your rear guard
Then you shall call and the LORD will answer you shall cry and he will say Here I am If you take away the yoke from your midst the pointing of the finger and speaking wickedness
if you pour yourself out for the hungry and satisfy the desire of the afflicted then shall your light rise in the darkness and your gloom be as the noonday
And the LORD will guide you continually and satisfy your desire in scorched places and make your bones strong and you shall be like a watered garden like a spring of water whose waters do not fail
And your ancient ruins shall be rebuilt you shall raise up the foundations of many generations you shall be called the repairer of the breach the restorer of streets to dwell in
If you turn back your foot from the Sabbath from doing your pleasure on my holy day and call the Sabbath a delight and the holy day of the LORD honorable if you honor it not going your own ways or seeking your own pleasure or talking idly
then you shall take delight in the LORD and I will make you ride on the heights of the earth I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father for the mouth of the LORD has spoken
