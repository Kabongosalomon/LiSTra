1 Samuel 1
There was a certain man of Ramathaim zophim of the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham son of Elihu son of Tohu son of Zuph an Ephrathite
He had two wives The name of the one was Hannah and the name of the other Peninnah And Peninnah had children but Hannah had no children
Now this man used to go up year by year from his city to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts at Shiloh where the two sons of Eli Hophni and Phinehas were priests of the LORD
On the day when Elkanah sacrificed he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters
But to Hannah he gave a double portion because he loved her though the LORD had closed her womb
And her rival used to provoke her grievously to irritate her because the LORD had closed her womb
So it went on year by year As often as she went up to the house of the LORD she used to provoke her Therefore Hannah wept and would not eat
And Elkanah her husband said to her Hannah why do you weep And why do you not eat And why is your heart sad Am I not more to you than ten sons
After they had eaten and drunk in Shiloh Hannah rose Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat beside the doorpost of the temple of the LORD
She was deeply distressed and prayed to the LORD and wept bitterly
And she vowed a vow and said O LORD of hosts if you will indeed look on the affliction of your servant and remember me and not forget your servant but will give to your servant a son then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life and no razor shall touch his head
As she continued praying before the LORD Eli observed her mouth
Hannah was speaking in her heart only her lips moved and her voice was not heard Therefore Eli took her to be a drunken woman
And Eli said to her How long will you go on being drunk Put your wine away from you
But Hannah answered No my lord I am a woman troubled in spirit I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but I have been pouring out my soul before the LORD
Do not regard your servant as a worthless woman for all along I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and vexation
Then Eli answered Go in peace and the God of Israel grant your petition that you have made to him
And she said Let your servant find favor in your eyes Then the woman went her way and ate and her face was no longer sad
They rose early in the morning and worshiped before the LORD then they went back to their house at Ramah And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife and the LORD remembered her
And in due time Hannah conceived and bore a son and she called his name Samuel for she said I have asked for him from the LORD
The man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice and to pay his vow
But Hannah did not go up for she said to her husband As soon as the child is weaned I will bring him so that he may appear in the presence of the LORD and dwell there forever
Elkanah her husband said to her Do what seems best to you wait until you have weaned him only may the LORD establish his word So the woman remained and nursed her son until she weaned him
And when she had weaned him she took him up with her along with a three year old bull an ephah of flour and a skin of wine and she brought him to the house of the LORD at Shiloh And the child was young
Then they slaughtered the bull and they brought the child to Eli
And she said Oh my lord As you live my lord I am the woman who was standing here in your presence praying to the LORD
For this child I prayed and the LORD has granted me my petition that I made to him
Therefore I have lent him to the LORD As long as he lives he is lent to the LORD And he worshiped the LORD there
