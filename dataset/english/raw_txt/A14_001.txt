2 Chronicles 1
Solomon the son of David established himself in his kingdom and the LORD his God was with him and made him exceedingly great
Solomon spoke to all Israel to the commanders of thousands and of hundreds to the judges and to all the leaders in all Israel the heads of fathers houses
And Solomon and all the assembly with him went to the high place that was at Gibeon for the tent of meeting of God which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness was there
But David had brought up the ark of God from Kiriath jearim to the place that David had prepared for it for he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem
Moreover the bronze altar that Bezalel the son of Uri son of Hur had made was there before the tabernacle of the LORD And Solomon and the assembly sought it out
And Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before the LORD which was at the tent of meeting and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it
In that night God appeared to Solomon and said to him Ask what I shall give you
And Solomon said to God You have shown great and steadfast love to David my father and have made me king in his place
O LORD God let your word to David my father be now fulfilled for you have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth
Give me now wisdom and knowledge to go out and come in before this people for who can govern this people of yours which is so great
God answered Solomon Because this was in your heart and you have not asked possessions wealth honor or the life of those who hate you and have not even asked long life but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself that you may govern my people over whom I have made you king
wisdom and knowledge are granted to you I will also give you riches possessions and honor such as none of the kings had who were before you and none after you shall have the like
So Solomon came from the high place at Gibeon from before the tent of meeting to Jerusalem And he reigned over Israel
Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen He had chariots and horsemen whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem
And the king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stone and he made cedar as plentiful as the sycamore of the Shephelah
And Solomon s import of horses was from Egypt and Kue and the king s traders would buy them from Kue for a price
They imported a chariot from Egypt for shekels of silver and a horse for Likewise through them these were exported to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria
