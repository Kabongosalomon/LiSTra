Deuteronomy 4
And now O Israel listen to the statutes and the rules that I am teaching you and do them that you may live and go in and take possession of the land that the LORD the God of your fathers is giving you
You shall not add to the word that I command you nor take from it that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God that I command you
Your eyes have seen what the LORD did at Baal peor for the LORD your God destroyed from among you all the men who followed the Baal of Peor
But you who held fast to the LORD your God are all alive today
See I have taught you statutes and rules as the LORD my God commanded me that you should do them in the land that you are entering to take possession of it
Keep them and do them for that will be your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples who when they hear all these statutes will say Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people
For what great nation is there that has a god so near to it as the LORD our God is to us whenever we call upon him
And what great nation is there that has statutes and rules so righteous as all this law that I set before you today
Only take care and keep your soul diligently lest you forget the things that your eyes have seen and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life Make them known to your children and your children s children
how on the day that you stood before the LORD your God at Horeb the LORD said to me Gather the people to me that I may let them hear my words so that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live on the earth and that they may teach their children so
And you came near and stood at the foot of the mountain while the mountain burned with fire to the heart of heaven wrapped in darkness cloud and gloom
Then the LORD spoke to you out of the midst of the fire You heard the sound of words but saw no form there was only a voice
And he declared to you his covenant which he commanded you to perform that is the Ten Commandments and he wrote them on two tablets of stone
And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and rules that you might do them in the land that you are going over to possess
Therefore watch yourselves very carefully Since you saw no form on the day that the LORD spoke to you at Horeb out of the midst of the fire
beware lest you act corruptly by making a carved image for yourselves in the form of any figure the likeness of male or female
the likeness of any animal that is on the earth the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the air
the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth
And beware lest you raise your eyes to heaven and when you see the sun and the moon and the stars all the host of heaven you be drawn away and bow down to them and serve them things that the LORD your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole heaven
But the LORD has taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace out of Egypt to be a people of his own inheritance as you are this day
Furthermore the LORD was angry with me because of you and he swore that I should not cross the Jordan and that I should not enter the good land that the LORD your God is giving you for an inheritance
For I must die in this land I must not go over the Jordan But you shall go over and take possession of that good land
Take care lest you forget the covenant of the LORD your God which he made with you and make a carved image the form of anything that the LORD your God has forbidden you
For the LORD your God is a consuming fire a jealous God
When you father children and children s children and have grown old in the land if you act corruptly by making a carved image in the form of anything and by doing what is evil in the sight of the LORD your God so as to provoke him to anger
I call heaven and earth to witness against you today that you will soon utterly perish from the land that you are going over the Jordan to possess You will not live long in it but will be utterly destroyed
And the LORD will scatter you among the peoples and you will be left few in number among the nations where the LORD will drive you
And there you will serve gods of wood and stone the work of human hands that neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell
But from there you will seek the LORD your God and you will find him if you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul
When you are in tribulation and all these things come upon you in the latter days you will return to the LORD your God and obey his voice
For the LORD your God is a merciful God He will not leave you or destroy you or forget the covenant with your fathers that he swore to them
For ask now of the days that are past which were before you since the day that God created man on the earth and ask from one end of heaven to the other whether such a great thing as this has ever happened or was ever heard of
Did any people ever hear the voice of a god speaking out of the midst of the fire as you have heard and still live
Or has any god ever attempted to go and take a nation for himself from the midst of another nation by trials by signs by wonders and by war by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and by great deeds of terror all of which the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes
To you it was shown that you might know that the LORD is God there is no other besides him
Out of heaven he let you hear his voice that he might discipline you And on earth he let you see his great fire and you heard his words out of the midst of the fire
And because he loved your fathers and chose their offspring after them and brought you out of Egypt with his own presence by his great power
driving out before you nations greater and mightier than yourselves to bring you in to give you their land for an inheritance as it is this day
know therefore today and lay it to your heart that the LORD is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath there is no other
Therefore you shall keep his statutes and his commandments which I command you today that it may go well with you and with your children after you and that you may prolong your days in the land that the LORD your God is giving you for all time
Then Moses set apart three cities in the east beyond the Jordan
that the manslayer might flee there anyone who kills his neighbor unintentionally without being at enmity with him in time past he may flee to one of these cities and save his life
Bezer in the wilderness on the tableland for the Reubenites Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites
This is the law that Moses set before the people of Israel
These are the testimonies the statutes and the rules which Moses spoke to the people of Israel when they came out of Egypt
beyond the Jordan in the valley opposite Beth peor in the land of Sihon the king of the Amorites who lived at Heshbon whom Moses and the people of Israel defeated when they came out of Egypt
And they took possession of his land and the land of Og the king of Bashan the two kings of the Amorites who lived to the east beyond the Jordan
from Aroer which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon as far as Mount Sirion that is Hermon
together with all the Arabah on the east side of the Jordan as far as the Sea of the Arabah under the slopes of Pisgah
