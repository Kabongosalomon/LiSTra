Isaiah 40
Comfort comfort my people says your God
Speak tenderly to Jerusalem and cry to her that her warfare is ended that her iniquity is pardoned that she has received from the LORD s hand double for all her sins
A voice cries In the wilderness prepare the way of the LORD make straight in the desert a highway for our God
Every valley shall be lifted up and every mountain and hill be made low the uneven ground shall become level and the rough places a plain
And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the LORD has spoken
A voice says Cry And I said What shall I cry All flesh is grass and all its beauty is like the flower of the field
The grass withers the flower fades when the breath of the LORD blows on it surely the people are grass
The grass withers the flower fades but the word of our God will stand forever
Get you up to a high mountain O Zion herald of good news lift up your voice with strength O Jerusalem herald of good news lift it up fear not say to the cities of Judah Behold your God
Behold the Lord GOD comes with might and his arm rules for him behold his reward is with him and his recompense before him
He will tend his flock like a shepherd he will gather the lambs in his arms he will carry them in his bosom and gently lead those that are with young
Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and marked off the heavens with a span enclosed the dust of the earth in a measure and weighed the mountains in scales and the hills in a balance
Who has measured the Spirit of the LORD or what man shows him his counsel
Whom did he consult and who made him understand Who taught him the path of justice and taught him knowledge and showed him the way of understanding
Behold the nations are like a drop from a bucket and are accounted as the dust on the scales behold he takes up the coastlands like fine dust
Lebanon would not suffice for fuel nor are its beasts enough for a burnt offering
All the nations are as nothing before him they are accounted by him as less than nothing and emptiness
To whom then will you liken God or what likeness compare with him
An idol A craftsman casts it and a goldsmith overlays it with gold and casts for it silver chains
He who is too impoverished for an offering chooses wood that will not rot he seeks out a skillful craftsman to set up an idol that will not move
Do you not know Do you not hear Has it not been told you from the beginning Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth
It is he who sits above the circle of the earth and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers who stretches out the heavens like a curtain and spreads them like a tent to dwell in
who brings princes to nothing and makes the rulers of the earth as emptiness
Scarcely are they planted scarcely sown scarcely has their stem taken root in the earth when he blows on them and they wither and the tempest carries them off like stubble
To whom then will you compare me that I should be like him says the Holy One
Lift up your eyes on high and see who created these He who brings out their host by number calling them all by name by the greatness of his might and because he is strong in power not one is missing
Why do you say O Jacob and speak O Israel My way is hidden from the LORD and my right is disregarded by my God
Have you not known Have you not heard The LORD is the everlasting God the Creator of the ends of the earth He does not faint or grow weary his understanding is unsearchable
He gives power to the faint and to him who has no might he increases strength
Even youths shall faint and be weary and young men shall fall exhausted
but they who wait for the LORD shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings like eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint
