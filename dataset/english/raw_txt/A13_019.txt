1 Chronicles 19
Now after this Nahash the king of the Ammonites died and his son reigned in his place
And David said I will deal kindly with Hanun the son of Nahash for his father dealt kindly with me So David sent messengers to console him concerning his father And David s servants came to the land of the Ammonites to Hanun to console him
But the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun Do you think because David has sent comforters to you that he is honoring your father Have not his servants come to you to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land
So Hanun took David s servants and shaved them and cut off their garments in the middle at their hips and sent them away
and they departed When David was told concerning the men he sent messengers to meet them for the men were greatly ashamed And the king said Remain at Jericho until your beards have grown and then return
When the Ammonites saw that they had become a stench to David Hanun and the Ammonites sent talents of silver to hire chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia from Aram maacah and from Zobah
They hired chariots and the king of Maacah with his army who came and encamped before Medeba And the Ammonites were mustered from their cities and came to battle
When David heard of it he sent Joab and all the army of the mighty men
And the Ammonites came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the city and the kings who had come were by themselves in the open country
When Joab saw that the battle was set against him both in front and in the rear he chose some of the best men of Israel and arrayed them against the Syrians
The rest of his men he put in the charge of Abishai his brother and they were arrayed against the Ammonites
And he said If the Syrians are too strong for me then you shall help me but if the Ammonites are too strong for you then I will help you
Be strong and let us use our strength for our people and for the cities of our God and may the LORD do what seems good to him
So Joab and the people who were with him drew near before the Syrians for battle and they fled before him
And when the Ammonites saw that the Syrians fled they likewise fled before Abishai Joab s brother and entered the city Then Joab came to Jerusalem
But when the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel they sent messengers and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the Euphrates with Shophach the commander of the army of Hadadezer at their head
And when it was told to David he gathered all Israel together and crossed the Jordan and came to them and drew up his forces against them And when David set the battle in array against the Syrians they fought with him
And the Syrians fled before Israel and David killed of the Syrians the men of chariots and foot soldiers and put to death also Shophach the commander of their army
And when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel they made peace with David and became subject to him So the Syrians were not willing to save the Ammonites anymore
