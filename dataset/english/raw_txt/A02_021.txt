Exodus 21
Now these are the rules that you shall set before them
When you buy a Hebrew slave he shall serve six years and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing
If he comes in single he shall go out single if he comes in married then his wife shall go out with him
If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters the wife and her children shall be her master s and he shall go out alone
But if the slave plainly says I love my master my wife and my children I will not go out free
then his master shall bring him to God and he shall bring him to the door or the doorpost And his master shall bore his ear through with an awl and he shall be his slave forever
When a man sells his daughter as a slave she shall not go out as the male slaves do
If she does not please her master who has designated her for himself then he shall let her be redeemed He shall have no right to sell her to a foreign people since he has broken faith with her
If he designates her for his son he shall deal with her as with a daughter
If he takes another wife to himself he shall not diminish her food her clothing or her marital rights
And if he does not do these three things for her she shall go out for nothing without payment of money
Whoever strikes a man so that he dies shall be put to death
But if he did not lie in wait for him but God let him fall into his hand then I will appoint for you a place to which he may flee
But if a man willfully attacks another to kill him by cunning you shall take him from my altar that he may die
Whoever strikes his father or his mother shall be put to death
Whoever steals a man and sells him and anyone found in possession of him shall be put to death
Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death
When men quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone or with his fist and the man does not die but takes to his bed
then if the man rises again and walks outdoors with his staff he who struck him shall be clear only he shall pay for the loss of his time and shall have him thoroughly healed
When a man strikes his slave male or female with a rod and the slave dies under his hand he shall be avenged
But if the slave survives a day or two he is not to be avenged for the slave is his money
When men strive together and hit a pregnant woman so that her children come out but there is no harm the one who hit her shall surely be fined as the woman s husband shall impose on him and he shall pay as the judges determine
But if there is harm then you shall pay life for life
eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot
burn for burn wound for wound stripe for stripe
When a man strikes the eye of his slave male or female and destroys it he shall let the slave go free because of his eye
If he knocks out the tooth of his slave male or female he shall let the slave go free because of his tooth
When an ox gores a man or a woman to death the ox shall be stoned and its flesh shall not be eaten but the owner of the ox shall not be liable
But if the ox has been accustomed to gore in the past and its owner has been warned but has not kept it in and it kills a man or a woman the ox shall be stoned and its owner also shall be put to death
If a ransom is imposed on him then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatever is imposed on him
If it gores a man s son or daughter he shall be dealt with according to this same rule
If the ox gores a slave male or female the owner shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver and the ox shall be stoned
When a man opens a pit or when a man digs a pit and does not cover it and an ox or a donkey falls into it
the owner of the pit shall make restoration He shall give money to its owner and the dead beast shall be his
When one man s ox butts another s so that it dies then they shall sell the live ox and share its price and the dead beast also they shall share
Or if it is known that the ox has been accustomed to gore in the past and its owner has not kept it in he shall repay ox for ox and the dead beast shall be his
