Job 9
Then Job answered and said
Truly I know that it is so But how can a man be in the right before God
If one wished to contend with him one could not answer him once in a thousand times
He is wise in heart and mighty in strength who has hardened himself against him and succeeded
he who removes mountains and they know it not when he overturns them in his anger
who shakes the earth out of its place and its pillars tremble
who commands the sun and it does not rise who seals up the stars
who alone stretched out the heavens and trampled the waves of the sea
who made the Bear and Orion the Pleiades and the chambers of the south
who does great things beyond searching out and marvelous things beyond number
Behold he passes by me and I see him not he moves on but I do not perceive him
Behold he snatches away who can turn him back Who will say to him What are you doing
God will not turn back his anger beneath him bowed the helpers of Rahab
How then can I answer him choosing my words with him
Though I am in the right I cannot answer him I must appeal for mercy to my accuser
If I summoned him and he answered me I would not believe that he was listening to my voice
For he crushes me with a tempest and multiplies my wounds without cause
he will not let me get my breath but fills me with bitterness
If it is a contest of strength behold he is mighty If it is a matter of justice who can summon him
Though I am in the right my own mouth would condemn me though I am blameless he would prove me perverse
I am blameless I regard not myself I loathe my life
It is all one therefore I say He destroys both the blameless and the wicked
When disaster brings sudden death he mocks at the calamity of the innocent
The earth is given into the hand of the wicked he covers the faces of its judges if it is not he who then is it
My days are swifter than a runner they flee away they see no good
They go by like skiffs of reed like an eagle swooping on the prey
If I say I will forget my complaint I will put off my sad face and be of good cheer
I become afraid of all my suffering for I know you will not hold me innocent
I shall be condemned why then do I labor in vain
If I wash myself with snow and cleanse my hands with lye
yet you will plunge me into a pit and my own clothes will abhor me
For he is not a man as I am that I might answer him that we should come to trial together
There is no arbiter between us who might lay his hand on us both
Let him take his rod away from me and let not dread of him terrify me
Then I would speak without fear of him for I am not so in myself
