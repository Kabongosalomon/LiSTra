Romans 16
I commend to you our sister Phoebe a servant of the church at Cenchreae
that you may welcome her in the Lord in a way worthy of the saints and help her in whatever she may need from you for she has been a patron of many and of myself as well
Greet Prisca and Aquila my fellow workers in Christ Jesus
who risked their necks for my life to whom not only I give thanks but all the churches of the Gentiles give thanks as well
Greet also the church in their house Greet my beloved Epaenetus who was the first convert to Christ in Asia
Greet Mary who has worked hard for you
Greet Andronicus and Junia my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners They are well known to the apostles and they were in Christ before me
Greet Ampliatus my beloved in the Lord
Greet Urbanus our fellow worker in Christ and my beloved Stachys
Greet Apelles who is approved in Christ Greet those who belong to the family of Aristobulus
Greet my kinsman Herodion Greet those in the Lord who belong to the family of Narcissus
Greet those workers in the Lord Tryphaena and Tryphosa Greet the beloved Persis who has worked hard in the Lord
Greet Rufus chosen in the Lord also his mother who has been a mother to me as well
Greet Asyncritus Phlegon Hermes Patrobas Hermas and the brothers who are with them
Greet Philologus Julia Nereus and his sister and Olympas and all the saints who are with them
Greet one another with a holy kiss All the churches of Christ greet you
I appeal to you brothers to watch out for those who cause divisions and create obstacles contrary to the doctrine that you have been taught avoid them
For such persons do not serve our Lord Christ but their own appetites and by smooth talk and flattery they deceive the hearts of the naive
For your obedience is known to all so that I rejoice over you but I want you to be wise as to what is good and innocent as to what is evil
The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you
Timothy my fellow worker greets you so do Lucius and Jason and Sosipater my kinsmen
I Tertius who wrote this letter greet you in the Lord
Gaius who is host to me and to the whole church greets you Erastus the city treasurer and our brother Quartus greet you
Now to him who is able to strengthen you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery that was kept secret for long ages
but has now been disclosed and through the prophetic writings has been made known to all nations according to the command of the eternal God to bring about the obedience of faith
to the only wise God be glory forevermore through Jesus Christ Amen
