Revelation 11
Then I was given a measuring rod like a staff and I was told Rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship there
but do not measure the court outside the temple leave that out for it is given over to the nations and they will trample the holy city for forty two months
And I will grant authority to my two witnesses and they will prophesy for days clothed in sackcloth
These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth
And if anyone would harm them fire pours from their mouth and consumes their foes If anyone would harm them this is how he is doomed to be killed
They have the power to shut the sky that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they desire
And when they have finished their testimony the beast that rises from the bottomless pit will make war on them and conquer them and kill them
and their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city that symbolically is called Sodom and Egypt where their Lord was crucified
For three and a half days some from the peoples and tribes and languages and nations will gaze at their dead bodies and refuse to let them be placed in a tomb
and those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them and make merry and exchange presents because these two prophets had been a torment to those who dwell on the earth
But after the three and a half days a breath of life from God entered them and they stood up on their feet and great fear fell on those who saw them
Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them Come up here And they went up to heaven in a cloud and their enemies watched them
And at that hour there was a great earthquake and a tenth of the city fell Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven
The second woe has passed behold the third woe is soon to come
Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet and there were loud voices in heaven saying The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ and he shall reign forever and ever
And the twenty four elders who sit on their thrones before God fell on their faces and worshiped God
saying We give thanks to you Lord God Almighty who is and who was for you have taken your great power and begun to reign
The nations raged but your wrath came and the time for the dead to be judged and for rewarding your servants the prophets and saints and those who fear your name both small and great and for destroying the destroyers of the earth
Then God s temple in heaven was opened and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple There were flashes of lightning rumblings peals of thunder an earthquake and heavy hail
