Jude 1
Jude a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James To those who are called beloved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ
May mercy peace and love be multiplied to you
Beloved although I was very eager to write to you about our common salvation I found it necessary to write appealing to you to contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints
For certain people have crept in unnoticed who long ago were designated for this condemnation ungodly people who pervert the grace of our God into sensuality and deny our only Master and Lord Jesus Christ
Now I want to remind you although you once fully knew it that Jesus who saved a people out of the land of Egypt afterward destroyed those who did not believe
And the angels who did not stay within their own position of authority but left their proper dwelling he has kept in eternal chains under gloomy darkness until the judgment of the great day
just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire
Yet in like manner these people also relying on their dreams defile the flesh reject authority and blaspheme the glorious ones
But when the archangel Michael contending with the devil was disputing about the body of Moses he did not presume to pronounce a blasphemous judgment but said The Lord rebuke you
But these people blaspheme all that they do not understand and they are destroyed by all that they like unreasoning animals understand instinctively
Woe to them For they walked in the way of Cain and abandoned themselves for the sake of gain to Balaam s error and perished in Korah s rebellion
These are hidden reefs at your love feasts as they feast with you without fear shepherds feeding themselves waterless clouds swept along by winds fruitless trees in late autumn twice dead uprooted
wild waves of the sea casting up the foam of their own shame wandering stars for whom the gloom of utter darkness has been reserved forever
It was also about these that Enoch the seventh from Adam prophesied saying Behold the Lord comes with ten thousands of his holy ones
to execute judgment on all and to convict all the ungodly of all their deeds of ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way and of all the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against him
These are grumblers malcontents following their own sinful desires they are loud mouthed boasters showing favoritism to gain advantage
But you must remember beloved the predictions of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ
They said to you In the last time there will be scoffers following their own ungodly passions
It is these who cause divisions worldly people devoid of the Spirit
But you beloved building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit
keep yourselves in the love of God waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life
And have mercy on those who doubt
save others by snatching them out of the fire to others show mercy with fear hating even the garment stained by the flesh
Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before the presence of his glory with great joy
to the only God our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord be glory majesty dominion and authority before all time and now and forever Amen
