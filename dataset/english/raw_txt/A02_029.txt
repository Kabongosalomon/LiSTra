You shall put them in one basket and bring them in the basket and bring the bull and the two rams
You shall bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the tent of meeting and wash them with water
Then you shall take the garments and put on Aaron the coat and the robe of the ephod and the ephod and the breastpiece and gird him with the skillfully woven band of the ephod
And you shall set the turban on his head and put the holy crown on the turban
You shall take the anointing oil and pour it on his head and anoint him
Then you shall bring his sons and put coats on them
and you shall gird Aaron and his sons with sashes and bind caps on them And the priesthood shall be theirs by a statute forever Thus you shall ordain Aaron and his sons
Then you shall bring the bull before the tent of meeting Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the bull
Then you shall kill the bull before the LORD at the entrance of the tent of meeting
and shall take part of the blood of the bull and put it on the horns of the altar with your finger and the rest of the blood you shall pour out at the base of the altar
And you shall take all the fat that covers the entrails and the long lobe of the liver and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them and burn them on the altar
But the flesh of the bull and its skin and its dung you shall burn with fire outside the camp it is a sin offering
Then you shall take one of the rams and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram
and you shall kill the ram and shall take its blood and throw it against the sides of the altar

You shall take the breast of the ram of Aaron s ordination and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD and it shall be your portion
