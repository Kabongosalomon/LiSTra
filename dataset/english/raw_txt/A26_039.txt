Ezekiel 39
And you son of man prophesy against Gog and say Thus says the Lord GOD Behold I am against you O Gog chief prince of Meshech and Tubal
And I will turn you about and drive you forward and bring you up from the uttermost parts of the north and lead you against the mountains of Israel
Then I will strike your bow from your left hand and will make your arrows drop out of your right hand
You shall fall on the mountains of Israel you and all your hordes and the peoples who are with you I will give you to birds of prey of every sort and to the beasts of the field to be devoured
You shall fall in the open field for I have spoken declares the Lord GOD
I will send fire on Magog and on those who dwell securely in the coastlands and they shall know that I am the LORD
And my holy name I will make known in the midst of my people Israel and I will not let my holy name be profaned anymore And the nations shall know that I am the LORD the Holy One in Israel
Behold it is coming and it will be brought about declares the Lord GOD That is the day of which I have spoken
Then those who dwell in the cities of Israel will go out and make fires of the weapons and burn them shields and bucklers bow and arrows clubs and spears and they will make fires of them for seven years
so that they will not need to take wood out of the field or cut down any out of the forests for they will make their fires of the weapons They will seize the spoil of those who despoiled them and plunder those who plundered them declares the Lord GOD
On that day I will give to Gog a place for burial in Israel the Valley of the Travelers east of the sea It will block the travelers for there Gog and all his multitude will be buried It will be called the Valley of Hamon gog
For seven months the house of Israel will be burying them in order to cleanse the land
All the people of the land will bury them and it will bring them renown on the day that I show my glory declares the Lord GOD
They will set apart men to travel through the land regularly and bury those travelers remaining on the face of the land so as to cleanse it At the end of seven months they will make their search
And when these travel through the land and anyone sees a human bone then he shall set up a sign by it till the buriers have buried it in the Valley of Hamon gog
Hamonah is also the name of the city Thus shall they cleanse the land
As for you son of man thus says the Lord GOD Speak to the birds of every sort and to all beasts of the field Assemble and come gather from all around to the sacrificial feast that I am preparing for you a great sacrificial feast on the mountains of Israel and you shall eat flesh and drink blood
You shall eat the flesh of the mighty and drink the blood of the princes of the earth of rams of lambs and of he goats of bulls all of them fat beasts of Bashan
And you shall eat fat till you are filled and drink blood till you are drunk at the sacrificial feast that I am preparing for you
And you shall be filled at my table with horses and charioteers with mighty men and all kinds of warriors declares the Lord GOD
And I will set my glory among the nations and all the nations shall see my judgment that I have executed and my hand that I have laid on them
The house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God from that day forward
And the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity because they dealt so treacherously with me that I hid my face from them and gave them into the hand of their adversaries and they all fell by the sword
I dealt with them according to their uncleanness and their transgressions and hid my face from them
Therefore thus says the Lord GOD Now I will restore the fortunes of Jacob and have mercy on the whole house of Israel and I will be jealous for my holy name
They shall forget their shame and all the treachery they have practiced against me when they dwell securely in their land with none to make them afraid
when I have brought them back from the peoples and gathered them from their enemies lands and through them have vindicated my holiness in the sight of many nations
Then they shall know that I am the LORD their God because I sent them into exile among the nations and then assembled them into their own land I will leave none of them remaining among the nations anymore
And I will not hide my face anymore from them when I pour out my Spirit upon the house of Israel declares the Lord GOD
