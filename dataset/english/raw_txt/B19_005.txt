Hebrews 5
For every high priest chosen from among men is appointed to act on behalf of men in relation to God to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins
He can deal gently with the ignorant and wayward since he himself is beset with weakness
Because of this he is obligated to offer sacrifice for his own sins just as he does for those of the people
And no one takes this honor for himself but only when called by God just as Aaron was
So also Christ did not exalt himself to be made a high priest but was appointed by him who said to him You are my Son today I have begotten you
as he says also in another place You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek
In the days of his flesh Jesus offered up prayers and supplications with loud cries and tears to him who was able to save him from death and he was heard because of his reverence
Although he was a son he learned obedience through what he suffered
And being made perfect he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him
being designated by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek
About this we have much to say and it is hard to explain since you have become dull of hearing
For though by this time you ought to be teachers you need someone to teach you again the basic principles of the oracles of God You need milk not solid food
for everyone who lives on milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness since he is a child
But solid food is for the mature for those who have their powers of discernment trained by constant practice to distinguish good from evil
