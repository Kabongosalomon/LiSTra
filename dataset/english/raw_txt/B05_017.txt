Acts 17
Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia they came to Thessalonica where there was a synagogue of the Jews
And Paul went in as was his custom and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures
explaining and proving that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead and saying This Jesus whom I proclaim to you is the Christ
And some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas as did a great many of the devout Greeks and not a few of the leading women
But the Jews were jealous and taking some wicked men of the rabble they formed a mob set the city in an uproar and attacked the house of Jason seeking to bring them out to the crowd
And when they could not find them they dragged Jason and some of the brothers before the city authorities shouting These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also
and Jason has received them and they are all acting against the decrees of Caesar saying that there is another king Jesus
And the people and the city authorities were disturbed when they heard these things
And when they had taken money as security from Jason and the rest they let them go
The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea and when they arrived they went into the Jewish synagogue
Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica they received the word with all eagerness examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so
Many of them therefore believed with not a few Greek women of high standing as well as men
But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Berea also they came there too agitating and stirring up the crowds
Then the brothers immediately sent Paul off on his way to the sea but Silas and Timothy remained there
Those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens and after receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible they departed
Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens his spirit was provoked within him as he saw that the city was full of idols
So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons and in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there
Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also conversed with him And some said What does this babbler wish to say Others said He seems to be a preacher of foreign divinities because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection
And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus saying May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting
For you bring some strange things to our ears We wish to know therefore what these things mean
Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there would spend their time in nothing except telling or hearing something new
So Paul standing in the midst of the Areopagus said Men of Athens I perceive that in every way you are very religious
For as I passed along and observed the objects of your worship I found also an altar with this inscription To the unknown god What therefore you worship as unknown this I proclaim to you
The God who made the world and everything in it being Lord of heaven and earth does not live in temples made by man
nor is he served by human hands as though he needed anything since he himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything
And he made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place
that they should seek God in the hope that they might feel their way toward him and find him Yet he is actually not far from each one of us
for In him we live and move and have our being as even some of your own poets have said For we are indeed his offspring
Being then God s offspring we ought not to think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone an image formed by the art and imagination of man
The times of ignorance God overlooked but now he commands all people everywhere to repent
because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead
Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead some mocked But others said We will hear you again about this
So Paul went out from their midst
But some men joined him and believed among whom also were Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them
