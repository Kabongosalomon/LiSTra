Genesis 40
Some time after this the cupbearer of the king of Egypt and his baker committed an offense against their lord the king of Egypt
And Pharaoh was angry with his two officers the chief cupbearer and the chief baker
and he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard in the prison where Joseph was confined
The captain of the guard appointed Joseph to be with them and he attended them They continued for some time in custody
And one night they both dreamed the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt who were confined in the prison each his own dream and each dream with its own interpretation
When Joseph came to them in the morning he saw that they were troubled
So he asked Pharaoh s officers who were with him in custody in his master s house Why are your faces downcast today
They said to him We have had dreams and there is no one to interpret them And Joseph said to them Do not interpretations belong to God Please tell them to me
So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph and said to him In my dream there was a vine before me
and on the vine there were three branches As soon as it budded its blossoms shot forth and the clusters ripened into grapes
Pharaoh s cup was in my hand and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh s cup and placed the cup in Pharaoh s hand
Then Joseph said to him This is its interpretation the three branches are three days
In three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office and you shall place Pharaoh s cup in his hand as formerly when you were his cupbearer
Only remember me when it is well with you and please do me the kindness to mention me to Pharaoh and so get me out of this house
For I was indeed stolen out of the land of the Hebrews and here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the pit
When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable he said to Joseph I also had a dream there were three cake baskets on my head
and in the uppermost basket there were all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh but the birds were eating it out of the basket on my head
And Joseph answered and said This is its interpretation the three baskets are three days
In three days Pharaoh will lift up your head from you and hang you on a tree And the birds will eat the flesh from you
On the third day which was Pharaoh s birthday he made a feast for all his servants and lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants
He restored the chief cupbearer to his position and he placed the cup in Pharaoh s hand
But he hanged the chief baker as Joseph had interpreted to them
Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph but forgot him
