Philippians 1
Paul and Timothy servants of Christ Jesus To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi with the overseers and deacons
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
I thank my God in all my remembrance of you
always in every prayer of mine for you all making my prayer with joy
because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now
And I am sure of this that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ
It is right for me to feel this way about you all because I hold you in my heart for you are all partakers with me of grace both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel
For God is my witness how I yearn for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus
And it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more with knowledge and all discernment
so that you may approve what is excellent and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ
filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God
I want you to know brothers that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel
so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard and to all the rest that my imprisonment is for Christ
And most of the brothers having become confident in the Lord by my imprisonment are much more bold to speak the word without fear
Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry but others from good will
The latter do it out of love knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel
The former proclaim Christ out of rivalry not sincerely but thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment
What then Only that in every way whether in pretense or in truth Christ is proclaimed and in that I rejoice Yes and I will rejoice
for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance
as it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body whether by life or by death
For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain
If I am to live in the flesh that means fruitful labor for me Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell
I am hard pressed between the two My desire is to depart and be with Christ for that is far better
But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account
Convinced of this I know that I will remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy in the faith
so that in me you may have ample cause to glory in Christ Jesus because of my coming to you again
Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ so that whether I come and see you or am absent I may hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit with one mind striving side by side for the faith of the gospel
and not frightened in anything by your opponents This is a clear sign to them of their destruction but of your salvation and that from God
For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake
engaged in the same conflict that you saw I had and now hear that I still have
