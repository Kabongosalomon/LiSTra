Romans 2
Therefore you have no excuse O man every one of you who judges For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself because you the judge practice the very same things
We know that the judgment of God rightly falls on those who practice such things
Do you suppose O man you who judge those who practice such things and yet do them yourself that you will escape the judgment of God
Or do you presume on the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience not knowing that God s kindness is meant to lead you to repentance
But because of your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God s righteous judgment will be revealed
He will render to each one according to his works
to those who by patience in well doing seek for glory and honor and immortality he will give eternal life
but for those who are self seeking and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness there will be wrath and fury
There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil the Jew first and also the Greek
but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good the Jew first and also the Greek
For God shows no partiality
For all who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law
For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God but the doers of the law who will be justified
For when Gentiles who do not have the law by nature do what the law requires they are a law to themselves even though they do not have the law
They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts while their conscience also bears witness and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them
on that day when according to my gospel God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus
But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God
and know his will and approve what is excellent because you are instructed from the law
and if you are sure that you yourself are a guide to the blind a light to those who are in darkness
an instructor of the foolish a teacher of children having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth
you then who teach others do you not teach yourself While you preach against stealing do you steal
You who say that one must not commit adultery do you commit adultery You who abhor idols do you rob temples
You who boast in the law dishonor God by breaking the law
For as it is written The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you
For circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law but if you break the law your circumcision becomes uncircumcision
So if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the precepts of the law will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision
Then he who is physically uncircumcised but keeps the law will condemn you who have the written code and circumcision but break the law
For no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly nor is circumcision outward and physical
But a Jew is one inwardly and circumcision is a matter of the heart by the Spirit not by the letter His praise is not from man but from God
