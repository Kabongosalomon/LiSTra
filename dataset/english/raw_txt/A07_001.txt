Judges 1
After the death of Joshua the people of Israel inquired of the LORD Who shall go up first for us against the Canaanites to fight against them
The LORD said Judah shall go up behold I have given the land into his hand
And Judah said to Simeon his brother Come up with me into the territory allotted to me that we may fight against the Canaanites And I likewise will go with you into the territory allotted to you So Simeon went with him
Then Judah went up and the LORD gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand and they defeated of them at Bezek
They found Adoni bezek at Bezek and fought against him and defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites
Adoni bezek fled but they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and his big toes
And Adoni bezek said Seventy kings with their thumbs and their big toes cut off used to pick up scraps under my table As I have done so God has repaid me And they brought him to Jerusalem and he died there
And the men of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire
And afterward the men of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country in the Negeb and in the lowland
And Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron now the name of Hebron was formerly Kiriath arba and they defeated Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai
From there they went against the inhabitants of Debir The name of Debir was formerly Kiriath sepher
And Caleb said He who attacks Kiriath sepher and captures it I will give him Achsah my daughter for a wife
And Othniel the son of Kenaz Caleb s younger brother captured it And he gave him Achsah his daughter for a wife
When she came to him she urged him to ask her father for a field And she dismounted from her donkey and Caleb said to her What do you want
She said to him Give me a blessing Since you have set me in the land of the Negeb give me also springs of water And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs
And the descendants of the Kenite Moses father in law went up with the people of Judah from the city of palms into the wilderness of Judah which lies in the Negeb near Arad and they went and settled with the people
And Judah went with Simeon his brother and they defeated the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath and devoted it to destruction So the name of the city was called Hormah
Judah also captured Gaza with its territory and Ashkelon with its territory and Ekron with its territory
And the LORD was with Judah and he took possession of the hill country but he could not drive out the inhabitants of the plain because they had chariots of iron
And Hebron was given to Caleb as Moses had said And he drove out from it the three sons of Anak
But the people of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem so the Jebusites have lived with the people of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day
The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel and the LORD was with them
And the house of Joseph scouted out Bethel Now the name of the city was formerly Luz
And the spies saw a man coming out of the city and they said to him Please show us the way into the city and we will deal kindly with you
And he showed them the way into the city And they struck the city with the edge of the sword but they let the man and all his family go
And the man went to the land of the Hittites and built a city and called its name Luz That is its name to this day
Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth shean and its villages or Taanach and its villages or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages for the Canaanites persisted in dwelling in that land
When Israel grew strong they put the Canaanites to forced labor but did not drive them out completely
And Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer so the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them
Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron or the inhabitants of Nahalol so the Canaanites lived among them but became subject to forced labor
Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco or the inhabitants of Sidon or of Ahlab or of Achzib or of Helbah or of Aphik or of Rehob
so the Asherites lived among the Canaanites the inhabitants of the land for they did not drive them out
Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth shemesh or the inhabitants of Beth anath so they lived among the Canaanites the inhabitants of the land Nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth shemesh and of Beth anath became subject to forced labor for them
The Amorites pressed the people of Dan back into the hill country for they did not allow them to come down to the plain
The Amorites persisted in dwelling in Mount Heres in Aijalon and in Shaalbim but the hand of the house of Joseph rested heavily on them and they became subject to forced labor
And the border of the Amorites ran from the ascent of Akrabbim from Sela and upward
