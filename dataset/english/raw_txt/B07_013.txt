1 Corienthians 13
If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but have not love I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal
And if I have prophetic powers and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains but have not love I am nothing
If I give away all I have and if I deliver up my body to be burned but have not love I gain nothing
Love is patient and kind love does not envy or boast it is not arrogant
or rude It does not insist on its own way it is not irritable or resentful
it does not rejoice at wrongdoing but rejoices with the truth
Love bears all things believes all things hopes all things endures all things
Love never ends As for prophecies they will pass away as for tongues they will cease as for knowledge it will pass away
For we know in part and we prophesy in part
but when the perfect comes the partial will pass away
When I was a child I spoke like a child I thought like a child I reasoned like a child When I became a man I gave up childish ways
For now we see in a mirror dimly but then face to face Now I know in part then I shall know fully even as I have been fully known
So now faith hope and love abide these three but the greatest of these is love
