Jeremiah 5
Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem look and take note Search her squares to see if you can find a man one who does justice and seeks truth that I may pardon her
Though they say As the LORD lives yet they swear falsely
O LORD do not your eyes look for truth You have struck them down but they felt no anguish you have consumed them but they refused to take correction They have made their faces harder than rock they have refused to repent
Then I said These are only the poor they have no sense for they do not know the way of the LORD the justice of their God
I will go to the great and will speak to them for they know the way of the LORD the justice of their God But they all alike had broken the yoke they had burst the bonds
Therefore a lion from the forest shall strike them down a wolf from the desert shall devastate them A leopard is watching their cities everyone who goes out of them shall be torn in pieces because their transgressions are many their apostasies are great
How can I pardon you Your children have forsaken me and have sworn by those who are no gods When I fed them to the full they committed adultery and trooped to the houses of whores
They were well fed lusty stallions each neighing for his neighbor s wife
Shall I not punish them for these things declares the LORD and shall I not avenge myself on a nation such as this
Go up through her vine rows and destroy but make not a full end strip away her branches for they are not the LORD s
For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have been utterly treacherous to me declares the LORD
They have spoken falsely of the LORD and have said He will do nothing no disaster will come upon us nor shall we see sword or famine
The prophets will become wind the word is not in them Thus shall it be done to them
Therefore thus says the LORD the God of hosts Because you have spoken this word behold I am making my words in your mouth a fire and this people wood and the fire shall consume them
Behold I am bringing against you a nation from afar O house of Israel declares the LORD It is an enduring nation it is an ancient nation a nation whose language you do not know nor can you understand what they say
Their quiver is like an open tomb they are all mighty warriors
They shall eat up your harvest and your food they shall eat up your sons and your daughters they shall eat up your flocks and your herds they shall eat up your vines and your fig trees your fortified cities in which you trust they shall beat down with the sword
But even in those days declares the LORD I will not make a full end of you
And when your people say Why has the LORD our God done all these things to us you shall say to them As you have forsaken me and served foreign gods in your land so you shall serve foreigners in a land that is not yours
Declare this in the house of Jacob proclaim it in Judah
Hear this O foolish and senseless people who have eyes but see not who have ears but hear not
Do you not fear me declares the LORD Do you not tremble before me I placed the sand as the boundary for the sea a perpetual barrier that it cannot pass though the waves toss they cannot prevail though they roar they cannot pass over it
But this people has a stubborn and rebellious heart they have turned aside and gone away
They do not say in their hearts Let us fear the LORD our God who gives the rain in its season the autumn rain and the spring rain and keeps for us the weeks appointed for the harvest
Your iniquities have turned these away and your sins have kept good from you
For wicked men are found among my people they lurk like fowlers lying in wait They set a trap they catch men
Like a cage full of birds their houses are full of deceit therefore they have become great and rich
they have grown fat and sleek They know no bounds in deeds of evil they judge not with justice the cause of the fatherless to make it prosper and they do not defend the rights of the needy
Shall I not punish them for these things declares the LORD and shall I not avenge myself on a nation such as this
An appalling and horrible thing has happened in the land
the prophets prophesy falsely and the priests rule at their direction my people love to have it so but what will you do when the end comes
