Matthew 28
Now after the Sabbath toward the dawn of the first day of the week Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb
And behold there was a great earthquake for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone and sat on it
His appearance was like lightning and his clothing white as snow
And for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men
But the angel said to the women Do not be afraid for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified
He is not here for he has risen as he said Come see the place where he lay
Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead and behold he is going before you to Galilee there you will see him See I have told you
So they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy and ran to tell his disciples
And behold Jesus met them and said Greetings And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him
Then Jesus said to them Do not be afraid go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee and there they will see me
While they were going behold some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests all that had taken place
And when they had assembled with the elders and taken counsel they gave a sufficient sum of money to the soldiers
and said Tell people His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep
And if this comes to the governor s ears we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble
So they took the money and did as they were directed And this story has been spread among the Jews to this day
Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them
And when they saw him they worshiped him but some doubted
And Jesus came and said to them All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you And behold I am with you always to the end of the age
