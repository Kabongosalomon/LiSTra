2 Samuel 16
When David had passed a little beyond the summit Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him with a couple of donkeys saddled bearing two hundred loaves of bread a hundred bunches of raisins a hundred of summer fruits and a skin of wine
And the king said to Ziba Why have you brought these Ziba answered The donkeys are for the king s household to ride on the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat and the wine for those who faint in the wilderness to drink
And the king said And where is your master s son Ziba said to the king Behold he remains in Jerusalem for he said Today the house of Israel will give me back the kingdom of my father
Then the king said to Ziba Behold all that belonged to Mephibosheth is now yours And Ziba said I pay homage let me ever find favor in your sight my lord the king
When King David came to Bahurim there came out a man of the family of the house of Saul whose name was Shimei the son of Gera and as he came he cursed continually
And he threw stones at David and at all the servants of King David and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left
And Shimei said as he cursed Get out get out you man of blood you worthless man
The LORD has avenged on you all the blood of the house of Saul in whose place you have reigned and the LORD has given the kingdom into the hand of your son Absalom See your evil is on you for you are a man of blood
Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king Let me go over and take off his head
But the king said What have I to do with you you sons of Zeruiah If he is cursing because the LORD has said to him Curse David who then shall say Why have you done so
And David said to Abishai and to all his servants Behold my own son seeks my life how much more now may this Benjaminite Leave him alone and let him curse for the LORD has told him to
It may be that the LORD will look on the wrong done to me and that the LORD will repay me with good for his cursing today
So David and his men went on the road while Shimei went along on the hillside opposite him and cursed as he went and threw stones at him and flung dust
And the king and all the people who were with him arrived weary at the Jordan And there he refreshed himself
Now Absalom and all the people the men of Israel came to Jerusalem and Ahithophel with him
And when Hushai the Archite David s friend came to Absalom Hushai said to Absalom Long live the king Long live the king
And Absalom said to Hushai Is this your loyalty to your friend Why did you not go with your friend
And Hushai said to Absalom No for whom the LORD and this people and all the men of Israel have chosen his I will be and with him I will remain
And again whom should I serve Should it not be his son As I have served your father so I will serve you
Then Absalom said to Ahithophel Give your counsel What shall we do
Ahithophel said to Absalom Go in to your father s concubines whom he has left to keep the house and all Israel will hear that you have made yourself a stench to your father and the hands of all who are with you will be strengthened
So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof And Absalom went in to his father s concubines in the sight of all Israel
Now in those days the counsel that Ahithophel gave was as if one consulted the word of God so was all the counsel of Ahithophel esteemed both by David and by Absalom
