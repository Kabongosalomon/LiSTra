Jeremiah 30
The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD
Thus says the LORD the God of Israel Write in a book all the words that I have spoken to you
For behold days are coming declares the LORD when I will restore the fortunes of my people Israel and Judah says the LORD and I will bring them back to the land that I gave to their fathers and they shall take possession of it
These are the words that the LORD spoke concerning Israel and Judah
Thus says the LORD We have heard a cry of panic of terror and no peace
Ask now and see can a man bear a child Why then do I see every man with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labor Why has every face turned pale
Alas That day is so great there is none like it it is a time of distress for Jacob yet he shall be saved out of it
And it shall come to pass in that day declares the LORD of hosts that I will break his yoke from off your neck and I will burst your bonds and foreigners shall no more make a servant of him
But they shall serve the LORD their God and David their king whom I will raise up for them
Then fear not O Jacob my servant declares the LORD nor be dismayed O Israel for behold I will save you from far away and your offspring from the land of their captivity Jacob shall return and have quiet and ease and none shall make him afraid
For I am with you to save you declares the LORD I will make a full end of all the nations among whom I scattered you but of you I will not make a full end I will discipline you in just measure and I will by no means leave you unpunished
For thus says the LORD Your hurt is incurable and your wound is grievous
There is none to uphold your cause no medicine for your wound no healing for you
All your lovers have forgotten you they care nothing for you for I have dealt you the blow of an enemy the punishment of a merciless foe because your guilt is great because your sins are flagrant
Why do you cry out over your hurt Your pain is incurable Because your guilt is great because your sins are flagrant I have done these things to you
Therefore all who devour you shall be devoured and all your foes every one of them shall go into captivity those who plunder you shall be plundered and all who prey on you I will make a prey
For I will restore health to you and your wounds I will heal declares the LORD because they have called you an outcast It is Zion for whom no one cares
Thus says the LORD Behold I will restore the fortunes of the tents of Jacob and have compassion on his dwellings the city shall be rebuilt on its mound and the palace shall stand where it used to be
Out of them shall come songs of thanksgiving and the voices of those who celebrate I will multiply them and they shall not be few I will make them honored and they shall not be small
Their children shall be as they were of old and their congregation shall be established before me and I will punish all who oppress them
Their prince shall be one of themselves their ruler shall come out from their midst I will make him draw near and he shall approach me for who would dare of himself to approach me declares the LORD
And you shall be my people and I will be your God
Behold the storm of the LORD Wrath has gone forth a whirling tempest it will burst upon the head of the wicked
The fierce anger of the LORD will not turn back until he has executed and accomplished the intentions of his mind In the latter days you will understand this
