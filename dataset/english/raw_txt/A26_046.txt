Ezekiel 46
Thus says the Lord GOD The gate of the inner court that faces east shall be shut on the six working days but on the Sabbath day it shall be opened and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened
The prince shall enter by the vestibule of the gate from outside and shall take his stand by the post of the gate The priests shall offer his burnt offering and his peace offerings and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate Then he shall go out but the gate shall not be shut until evening
The people of the land shall bow down at the entrance of that gate before the LORD on the Sabbaths and on the new moons
The burnt offering that the prince offers to the LORD on the Sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish
And the grain offering with the ram shall be an ephah and the grain offering with the lambs shall be as much as he is able together with a hin of oil to each ephah
On the day of the new moon he shall offer a bull from the herd without blemish and six lambs and a ram which shall be without blemish
As a grain offering he shall provide an ephah with the bull and an ephah with the ram and with the lambs as much as he is able together with a hin of oil to each ephah
When the prince enters he shall enter by the vestibule of the gate and he shall go out by the same way
When the people of the land come before the LORD at the appointed feasts he who enters by the north gate to worship shall go out by the south gate and he who enters by the south gate shall go out by the north gate no one shall return by way of the gate by which he entered but each shall go out straight ahead
When they enter the prince shall enter with them and when they go out he shall go out
At the feasts and the appointed festivals the grain offering with a young bull shall be an ephah and with a ram an ephah and with the lambs as much as one is able to give together with a hin of oil to an ephah
When the prince provides a freewill offering either a burnt offering or peace offerings as a freewill offering to the LORD the gate facing east shall be opened for him And he shall offer his burnt offering or his peace offerings as he does on the Sabbath day Then he shall go out and after he has gone out the gate shall be shut
You shall provide a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering to the LORD daily morning by morning you shall provide it
And you shall provide a grain offering with it morning by morning one sixth of an ephah and one third of a hin of oil to moisten the flour as a grain offering to the LORD This is a perpetual statute
Thus the lamb and the meal offering and the oil shall be provided morning by morning for a regular burnt offering
Thus says the Lord GOD If the prince makes a gift to any of his sons as his inheritance it shall belong to his sons It is their property by inheritance
But if he makes a gift out of his inheritance to one of his servants it shall be his to the year of liberty Then it shall revert to the prince surely it is his inheritance it shall belong to his sons
The prince shall not take any of the inheritance of the people thrusting them out of their property He shall give his sons their inheritance out of his own property so that none of my people shall be scattered from his property
Then he brought me through the entrance which was at the side of the gate to the north row of the holy chambers for the priests and behold a place was there at the extreme western end of them
And he said to me This is the place where the priests shall boil the guilt offering and the sin offering and where they shall bake the grain offering in order not to bring them out into the outer court and so transmit holiness to the people
Then he brought me out to the outer court and led me around to the four corners of the court And behold in each corner of the court there was another court
in the four corners of the court were small courts forty cubits long and thirty broad the four were of the same size
On the inside around each of the four courts was a row of masonry with hearths made at the bottom of the rows all around
Then he said to me These are the kitchens where those who minister at the temple shall boil the sacrifices of the people
