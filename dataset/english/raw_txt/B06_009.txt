Romans 9
I am speaking the truth in Christ I am not lying my conscience bears me witness in the Holy Spirit
that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart
For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers my kinsmen according to the flesh
They are Israelites and to them belong the adoption the glory the covenants the giving of the law the worship and the promises
To them belong the patriarchs and from their race according to the flesh is the Christ who is God over all blessed forever Amen
But it is not as though the word of God has failed For not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel
and not all are children of Abraham because they are his offspring but Through Isaac shall your offspring be named
This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God but the children of the promise are counted as offspring
For this is what the promise said About this time next year I will return and Sarah shall have a son
And not only so but also when Rebekah had conceived children by one man our forefather Isaac
though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad in order that God s purpose of election might continue not because of works but because of him who calls
she was told The older will serve the younger
As it is written Jacob I loved but Esau I hated
What shall we say then Is there injustice on God s part By no means
For he says to Moses I will have mercy on whom I have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion
So then it depends not on human will or exertion but on God who has mercy
For the Scripture says to Pharaoh For this very purpose I have raised you up that I might show my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth
So then he has mercy on whomever he wills and he hardens whomever he wills
You will say to me then Why does he still find fault For who can resist his will
But who are you O man to answer back to God Will what is molded say to its molder Why have you made me like this
Has the potter no right over the clay to make out of the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for dishonorable use
What if God desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction
in order to make known the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy which he has prepared beforehand for glory
even us whom he has called not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles
As indeed he says in Hosea Those who were not my people I will call my people and her who was not beloved I will call beloved
And in the very place where it was said to them You are not my people there they will be called sons of the living God
And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel Though the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea only a remnant of them will be saved
for the Lord will carry out his sentence upon the earth fully and without delay
And as Isaiah predicted If the Lord of hosts had not left us offspring we would have been like Sodom and become like Gomorrah
What shall we say then That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it that is a righteousness that is by faith
but that Israel who pursued a law that would lead to righteousness did not succeed in reaching that law
Why Because they did not pursue it by faith but as if it were based on works They have stumbled over the stumbling stone
as it is written Behold I am laying in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame
