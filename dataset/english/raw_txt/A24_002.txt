Jeremiah 2
The word of the LORD came to me saying
Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem Thus says the LORD I remember the devotion of your youth your love as a bride how you followed me in the wilderness in a land not sown
Israel was holy to the LORD the firstfruits of his harvest All who ate of it incurred guilt disaster came upon them declares the LORD
Hear the word of the LORD O house of Jacob and all the clans of the house of Israel
Thus says the LORD What wrong did your fathers find in me that they went far from me and went after worthlessness and became worthless
They did not say Where is the LORD who brought us up from the land of Egypt who led us in the wilderness in a land of deserts and pits in a land of drought and deep darkness in a land that none passes through where no man dwells
And I brought you into a plentiful land to enjoy its fruits and its good things But when you came in you defiled my land and made my heritage an abomination
The priests did not say Where is the LORD Those who handle the law did not know me the shepherds transgressed against me the prophets prophesied by Baal and went after things that do not profit
Therefore I still contend with you declares the LORD and with your children s children I will contend
For cross to the coasts of Cyprus and see or send to Kedar and examine with care see if there has been such a thing
Has a nation changed its gods even though they are no gods But my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit
Be appalled O heavens at this be shocked be utterly desolate declares the LORD
for my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters and hewed out cisterns for themselves broken cisterns that can hold no water
Is Israel a slave Is he a homeborn servant Why then has he become a prey
The lions have roared against him they have roared loudly They have made his land a waste his cities are in ruins without inhabitant
Moreover the men of Memphis and Tahpanhes have shaved the crown of your head
Have you not brought this upon yourself by forsaking the LORD your God when he led you in the way
And now what do you gain by going to Egypt to drink the waters of the Nile Or what do you gain by going to Assyria to drink the waters of the Euphrates
Your evil will chastise you and your apostasy will reprove you Know and see that it is evil and bitter for you to forsake the LORD your God the fear of me is not in you declares the Lord GOD of hosts
For long ago I broke your yoke and burst your bonds but you said I will not serve Yes on every high hill and under every green tree you bowed down like a whore
Yet I planted you a choice vine wholly of pure seed How then have you turned degenerate and become a wild vine
Though you wash yourself with lye and use much soap the stain of your guilt is still before me declares the Lord GOD
How can you say I am not unclean I have not gone after the Baals Look at your way in the valley know what you have done a restless young camel running here and there
a wild donkey used to the wilderness in her heat sniffing the wind Who can restrain her lust None who seek her need weary themselves in her month they will find her
Keep your feet from going unshod and your throat from thirst But you said It is hopeless for I have loved foreigners and after them I will go
As a thief is shamed when caught so the house of Israel shall be shamed they their kings their officials their priests and their prophets
who say to a tree You are my father and to a stone You gave me birth For they have turned their back to me and not their face But in the time of their trouble they say Arise and save us
But where are your gods that you made for yourself Let them arise if they can save you in your time of trouble for as many as your cities are your gods O Judah
Why do you contend with me You have all transgressed against me declares the LORD
In vain have I struck your children they took no correction your own sword devoured your prophets like a ravening lion
And you O generation behold the word of the LORD Have I been a wilderness to Israel or a land of thick darkness Why then do my people say We are free we will come no more to you
Can a virgin forget her ornaments or a bride her attire Yet my people have forgotten me days without number
How well you direct your course to seek love So that even to wicked women you have taught your ways
Also on your skirts is found the lifeblood of the guiltless poor you did not find them breaking in Yet in spite of all these things
you say I am innocent surely his anger has turned from me Behold I will bring you to judgment for saying I have not sinned
How much you go about changing your way You shall be put to shame by Egypt as you were put to shame by Assyria
From it too you will come away with your hands on your head for the LORD has rejected those in whom you trust and you will not prosper by them
