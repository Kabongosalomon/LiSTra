2 Corienthians 7
Since we have these promises beloved let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit bringing holiness to completion in the fear of God
Make room in your hearts for us We have wronged no one we have corrupted no one we have taken advantage of no one
I do not say this to condemn you for I said before that you are in our hearts to die together and to live together
I am acting with great boldness toward you I have great pride in you I am filled with comfort In all our affliction I am overflowing with joy
For even when we came into Macedonia our bodies had no rest but we were afflicted at every turn fighting without and fear within
But God who comforts the downcast comforted us by the coming of Titus
and not only by his coming but also by the comfort with which he was comforted by you as he told us of your longing your mourning your zeal for me so that I rejoiced still more
For even if I made you grieve with my letter I do not regret it though I did regret it for I see that that letter grieved you though only for a while
As it is I rejoice not because you were grieved but because you were grieved into repenting For you felt a godly grief so that you suffered no loss through us
For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret whereas worldly grief produces death
For see what earnestness this godly grief has produced in you but also what eagerness to clear yourselves what indignation what fear what longing what zeal what punishment At every point you have proved yourselves innocent in the matter
So although I wrote to you it was not for the sake of the one who did the wrong nor for the sake of the one who suffered the wrong but in order that your earnestness for us might be revealed to you in the sight of God
Therefore we are comforted And besides our own comfort we rejoiced still more at the joy of Titus because his spirit has been refreshed by you all
For whatever boasts I made to him about you I was not put to shame But just as everything we said to you was true so also our boasting before Titus has proved true
And his affection for you is even greater as he remembers the obedience of you all how you received him with fear and trembling
I rejoice because I have perfect confidence in you
