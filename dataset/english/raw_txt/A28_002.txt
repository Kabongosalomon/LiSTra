Hosea 2
Say to your brothers You are my people and to your sisters You have received mercy
Plead with your mother plead for she is not my wife and I am not her husband that she put away her whoring from her face and her adultery from between her breasts
lest I strip her naked and make her as in the day she was born and make her like a wilderness and make her like a parched land and kill her with thirst
Upon her children also I will have no mercy because they are children of whoredom
For their mother has played the whore she who conceived them has acted shamefully For she said I will go after my lovers who give me my bread and my water my wool and my flax my oil and my drink
Therefore I will hedge up her way with thorns and I will build a wall against her so that she cannot find her paths
She shall pursue her lovers but not overtake them and she shall seek them but shall not find them Then she shall say I will go and return to my first husband for it was better for me then than now
And she did not know that it was I who gave her the grain the wine and the oil and who lavished on her silver and gold which they used for Baal
Therefore I will take back my grain in its time and my wine in its season and I will take away my wool and my flax which were to cover her nakedness
Now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers and no one shall rescue her out of my hand
And I will put an end to all her mirth her feasts her new moons her Sabbaths and all her appointed feasts
And I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees of which she said These are my wages which my lovers have given me I will make them a forest and the beasts of the field shall devour them
And I will punish her for the feast days of the Baals when she burned offerings to them and adorned herself with her ring and jewelry and went after her lovers and forgot me declares the LORD
Therefore behold I will allure her and bring her into the wilderness and speak tenderly to her
And there I will give her her vineyards and make the Valley of Achor a door of hope And there she shall answer as in the days of her youth as at the time when she came out of the land of Egypt
And in that day declares the LORD you will call me My Husband and no longer will you call me My Baal
For I will remove the names of the Baals from her mouth and they shall be remembered by name no more
And I will make for them a covenant on that day with the beasts of the field the birds of the heavens and the creeping things of the ground And I will abolish the bow the sword and war from the land and I will make you lie down in safety
And I will betroth you to me forever I will betroth you to me in righteousness and in justice in steadfast love and in mercy
I will betroth you to me in faithfulness And you shall know the LORD
And in that day I will answer declares the LORD I will answer the heavens and they shall answer the earth
and the earth shall answer the grain the wine and the oil and they shall answer Jezreel
and I will sow her for myself in the land And I will have mercy on No Mercy and I will say to Not My People You are my people and he shall say You are my God
