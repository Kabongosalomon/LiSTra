Isaiah 8
Then the LORD said to me Take a large tablet and write on it in common characters Belonging to Maher shalal hash baz
And I will get reliable witnesses Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah to attest for me
And I went to the prophetess and she conceived and bore a son Then the LORD said to me Call his name Maher shalal hash baz
for before the boy knows how to cry My father or My mother the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria will be carried away before the king of Assyria
The LORD spoke to me again
Because this people has refused the waters of Shiloah that flow gently and rejoice over Rezin and the son of Remaliah
therefore behold the Lord is bringing up against them the waters of the River mighty and many the king of Assyria and all his glory And it will rise over all its channels and go over all its banks
and it will sweep on into Judah it will overflow and pass on reaching even to the neck and its outspread wings will fill the breadth of your land O Immanuel
Be broken you peoples and be shattered give ear all you far countries strap on your armor and be shattered strap on your armor and be shattered
Take counsel together but it will come to nothing speak a word but it will not stand for God is with us
For the LORD spoke thus to me with his strong hand upon me and warned me not to walk in the way of this people saying
Do not call conspiracy all that this people calls conspiracy and do not fear what they fear nor be in dread
But the LORD of hosts him you shall honor as holy Let him be your fear and let him be your dread
And he will become a sanctuary and a stone of offense and a rock of stumbling to both houses of Israel a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem
And many shall stumble on it They shall fall and be broken they shall be snared and taken
Bind up the testimony seal the teaching among my disciples
I will wait for the LORD who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob and I will hope in him
Behold I and the children whom the LORD has given me are signs and portents in Israel from the LORD of hosts who dwells on Mount Zion
And when they say to you Inquire of the mediums and the necromancers who chirp and mutter should not a people inquire of their God Should they inquire of the dead on behalf of the living
To the teaching and to the testimony If they will not speak according to this word it is because they have no dawn
They will pass through the land greatly distressed and hungry And when they are hungry they will be enraged and will speak contemptuously against their king and their God and turn their faces upward
And they will look to the earth but behold distress and darkness the gloom of anguish And they will be thrust into thick darkness
