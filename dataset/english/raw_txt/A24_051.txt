Jeremiah 51
Thus says the LORD Behold I will stir up the spirit of a destroyer against Babylon against the inhabitants of Leb kamai
and I will send to Babylon winnowers and they shall winnow her and they shall empty her land when they come against her from every side on the day of trouble
Let not the archer bend his bow and let him not stand up in his armor Spare not her young men devote to destruction all her army
They shall fall down slain in the land of the Chaldeans and wounded in her streets
For Israel and Judah have not been forsaken by their God the LORD of hosts but the land of the Chaldeans is full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel
Flee from the midst of Babylon let every one save his life Be not cut off in her punishment for this is the time of the LORD s vengeance the repayment he is rendering her
Babylon was a golden cup in the LORD s hand making all the earth drunken the nations drank of her wine therefore the nations went mad
Suddenly Babylon has fallen and been broken wail for her Take balm for her pain perhaps she may be healed
We would have healed Babylon but she was not healed Forsake her and let us go each to his own country for her judgment has reached up to heaven and has been lifted up even to the skies
The LORD has brought about our vindication come let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God
Sharpen the arrows Take up the shields The LORD has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes because his purpose concerning Babylon is to destroy it for that is the vengeance of the LORD the vengeance for his temple
Set up a standard against the walls of Babylon make the watch strong set up watchmen prepare the ambushes for the LORD has both planned and done what he spoke concerning the inhabitants of Babylon
O you who dwell by many waters rich in treasures your end has come the thread of your life is cut
The LORD of hosts has sworn by himself Surely I will fill you with men as many as locusts and they shall raise the shout of victory over you
It is he who made the earth by his power who established the world by his wisdom and by his understanding stretched out the heavens
When he utters his voice there is a tumult of waters in the heavens and he makes the mist rise from the ends of the earth He makes lightning for the rain and he brings forth the wind from his storehouses
Every man is stupid and without knowledge every goldsmith is put to shame by his idols for his images are false and there is no breath in them
They are worthless a work of delusion at the time of their punishment they shall perish
Not like these is he who is the portion of Jacob for he is the one who formed all things and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance the LORD of hosts is his name
You are my hammer and weapon of war with you I break nations in pieces with you I destroy kingdoms
with you I break in pieces the horse and his rider with you I break in pieces the chariot and the charioteer
with you I break in pieces man and woman with you I break in pieces the old man and the youth with you I break in pieces the young man and the young woman
with you I break in pieces the shepherd and his flock with you I break in pieces the farmer and his team with you I break in pieces governors and commanders
I will repay Babylon and all the inhabitants of Chaldea before your very eyes for all the evil that they have done in Zion declares the LORD
Behold I am against you O destroying mountain declares the LORD which destroys the whole earth I will stretch out my hand against you and roll you down from the crags and make you a burnt mountain
No stone shall be taken from you for a corner and no stone for a foundation but you shall be a perpetual waste declares the LORD
Set up a standard on the earth blow the trumpet among the nations prepare the nations for war against her summon against her the kingdoms Ararat Minni and Ashkenaz appoint a marshal against her bring up horses like bristling locusts
Prepare the nations for war against her the kings of the Medes with their governors and deputies and every land under their dominion
The land trembles and writhes in pain for the LORD s purposes against Babylon stand to make the land of Babylon a desolation without inhabitant
The warriors of Babylon have ceased fighting they remain in their strongholds their strength has failed they have become women her dwellings are on fire her bars are broken
One runner runs to meet another and one messenger to meet another to tell the king of Babylon that his city is taken on every side
the fords have been seized the marshes are burned with fire and the soldiers are in panic
For thus says the LORD of hosts the God of Israel The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor at the time when it is trodden yet a little while and the time of her harvest will come
Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me he has crushed me he has made me an empty vessel he has swallowed me like a monster he has filled his stomach with my delicacies he has rinsed me out
The violence done to me and to my kinsmen be upon Babylon let the inhabitant of Zion say My blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea let Jerusalem say
Therefore thus says the LORD Behold I will plead your cause and take vengeance for you I will dry up her sea and make her fountain dry
and Babylon shall become a heap of ruins the haunt of jackals a horror and a hissing without inhabitant
They shall roar together like lions they shall growl like lions cubs
While they are inflamed I will prepare them a feast and make them drunk that they may become merry then sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake declares the LORD
I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter like rams and male goats
How Babylon is taken the praise of the whole earth seized How Babylon has become a horror among the nations
The sea has come up on Babylon she is covered with its tumultuous waves
Her cities have become a horror a land of drought and a desert a land in which no one dwells and through which no son of man passes
And I will punish Bel in Babylon and take out of his mouth what he has swallowed The nations shall no longer flow to him the wall of Babylon has fallen
Go out of the midst of her my people Let every one save his life from the fierce anger of the LORD
Let not your heart faint and be not fearful at the report heard in the land when a report comes in one year and afterward a report in another year and violence is in the land and ruler is against ruler
Therefore behold the days are coming when I will punish the images of Babylon her whole land shall be put to shame and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her
Then the heavens and the earth and all that is in them shall sing for joy over Babylon for the destroyers shall come against them out of the north declares the LORD
Babylon must fall for the slain of Israel just as for Babylon have fallen the slain of all the earth
You who have escaped from the sword go do not stand still Remember the LORD from far away and let Jerusalem come into your mind
We are put to shame for we have heard reproach dishonor has covered our face for foreigners have come into the holy places of the LORD s house
Therefore behold the days are coming declares the LORD when I will execute judgment upon her images and through all her land the wounded shall groan
Though Babylon should mount up to heaven and though she should fortify her strong height yet destroyers would come from me against her declares the LORD
A voice A cry from Babylon The noise of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans
For the LORD is laying Babylon waste and stilling her mighty voice Their waves roar like many waters the noise of their voice is raised
for a destroyer has come upon her upon Babylon her warriors are taken their bows are broken in pieces for the LORD is a God of recompense he will surely repay
I will make drunk her officials and her wise men her governors her commanders and her warriors they shall sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake declares the King whose name is the LORD of hosts
Thus says the LORD of hosts The broad wall of Babylon shall be leveled to the ground and her high gates shall be burned with fire The peoples labor for nothing and the nations weary themselves only for fire
The word that Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah son of Mahseiah when he went with Zedekiah king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign Seraiah was the quartermaster
Jeremiah wrote in a book all the disaster that should come upon Babylon all these words that are written concerning Babylon
And Jeremiah said to Seraiah When you come to Babylon see that you read all these words
and say O LORD you have said concerning this place that you will cut it off so that nothing shall dwell in it neither man nor beast and it shall be desolate forever
When you finish reading this book tie a stone to it and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates
and say Thus shall Babylon sink to rise no more because of the disaster that I am bringing upon her and they shall become exhausted Thus far are the words of Jeremiah
