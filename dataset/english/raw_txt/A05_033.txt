Deuteronomy 33
This is the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the people of Israel before his death
He said The LORD came from Sinai and dawned from Seir upon us he shone forth from Mount Paran he came from the ten thousands of holy ones with flaming fire at his right hand
Yes he loved his people all his holy ones were in his hand so they followed in your steps receiving direction from you
when Moses commanded us a law as a possession for the assembly of Jacob
Thus the LORD became king in Jeshurun when the heads of the people were gathered all the tribes of Israel together
Let Reuben live and not die but let his men be few
And this he said of Judah Hear O LORD the voice of Judah and bring him in to his people With your hands contend for him and be a help against his adversaries
And of Levi he said Give to Levi your Thummim and your Urim to your godly one whom you tested at Massah with whom you quarreled at the waters of Meribah
who said of his father and mother I regard them not he disowned his brothers and ignored his children For they observed your word and kept your covenant
They shall teach Jacob your rules and Israel your law they shall put incense before you and whole burnt offerings on your altar
Bless O LORD his substance and accept the work of his hands crush the loins of his adversaries of those who hate him that they rise not again
Of Benjamin he said The beloved of the LORD dwells in safety The High God surrounds him all day long and dwells between his shoulders
And of Joseph he said Blessed by the LORD be his land with the choicest gifts of heaven above and of the deep that crouches beneath
with the choicest fruits of the sun and the rich yield of the months
with the finest produce of the ancient mountains and the abundance of the everlasting hills
with the best gifts of the earth and its fullness and the favor of him who dwells in the bush May these rest on the head of Joseph on the pate of him who is prince among his brothers
A firstborn bull he has majesty and his horns are the horns of a wild ox with them he shall gore the peoples all of them to the ends of the earth they are the ten thousands of Ephraim and they are the thousands of Manasseh
And of Zebulun he said Rejoice Zebulun in your going out and Issachar in your tents
They shall call peoples to their mountain there they offer right sacrifices for they draw from the abundance of the seas and the hidden treasures of the sand
And of Gad he said Blessed be he who enlarges Gad Gad crouches like a lion he tears off arm and scalp
He chose the best of the land for himself for there a commander s portion was reserved and he came with the heads of the people with Israel he executed the justice of the LORD and his judgments for Israel
And of Dan he said Dan is a lion s cub that leaps from Bashan
And of Naphtali he said O Naphtali sated with favor and full of the blessing of the LORD possess the lake and the south
And of Asher he said Most blessed of sons be Asher let him be the favorite of his brothers and let him dip his foot in oil
Your bars shall be iron and bronze and as your days so shall your strength be
There is none like God O Jeshurun who rides through the heavens to your help through the skies in his majesty
The eternal God is your dwelling place and underneath are the everlasting arms And he thrust out the enemy before you and said Destroy
So Israel lived in safety Jacob lived alone in a land of grain and wine whose heavens drop down dew
Happy are you O Israel Who is like you a people saved by the LORD the shield of your help and the sword of your triumph Your enemies shall come fawning to you and you shall tread upon their backs
