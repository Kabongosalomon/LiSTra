Proverbs 17
Better is a dry morsel with quiet than a house full of feasting with strife
A servant who deals wisely will rule over a son who acts shamefully and will share the inheritance as one of the brothers
The crucible is for silver and the furnace is for gold and the LORD tests hearts
An evildoer listens to wicked lips and a liar gives ear to a mischievous tongue
Whoever mocks the poor insults his Maker he who is glad at calamity will not go unpunished
Grandchildren are the crown of the aged and the glory of children is their fathers
Fine speech is not becoming to a fool still less is false speech to a prince
A bribe is like a magic stone in the eyes of the one who gives it wherever he turns he prospers
Whoever covers an offense seeks love but he who repeats a matter separates close friends
A rebuke goes deeper into a man of understanding than a hundred blows into a fool
An evil man seeks only rebellion and a cruel messenger will be sent against him
Let a man meet a she bear robbed of her cubs rather than a fool in his folly
If anyone returns evil for good evil will not depart from his house
The beginning of strife is like letting out water so quit before the quarrel breaks out
He who justifies the wicked and he who condemns the righteous are both alike an abomination to the LORD
Why should a fool have money in his hand to buy wisdom when he has no sense
A friend loves at all times and a brother is born for adversity
One who lacks sense gives a pledge and puts up security in the presence of his neighbor
Whoever loves transgression loves strife he who makes his door high seeks destruction
A man of crooked heart does not discover good and one with a dishonest tongue falls into calamity
He who sires a fool gets himself sorrow and the father of a fool has no joy
A joyful heart is good medicine but a crushed spirit dries up the bones
The wicked accepts a bribe in secret to pervert the ways of justice
The discerning sets his face toward wisdom but the eyes of a fool are on the ends of the earth
A foolish son is a grief to his father and bitterness to her who bore him
To impose a fine on a righteous man is not good nor to strike the noble for their uprightness
Whoever restrains his words has knowledge and he who has a cool spirit is a man of understanding
Even a fool who keeps silent is considered wise when he closes his lips he is deemed intelligent
