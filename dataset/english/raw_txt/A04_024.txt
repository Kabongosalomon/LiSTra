Numbers 24
When Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel he did not go as at other times to look for omens but set his face toward the wilderness
And Balaam lifted up his eyes and saw Israel camping tribe by tribe And the Spirit of God came upon him
and he took up his discourse and said The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor the oracle of the man whose eye is opened
the oracle of him who hears the words of God who sees the vision of the Almighty falling down with his eyes uncovered
How lovely are your tents O Jacob your encampments O Israel
Like palm groves that stretch afar like gardens beside a river like aloes that the LORD has planted like cedar trees beside the waters
Water shall flow from his buckets and his seed shall be in many waters his king shall be higher than Agag and his kingdom shall be exalted
God brings him out of Egypt and is for him like the horns of the wild ox he shall eat up the nations his adversaries and shall break their bones in pieces and pierce them through with his arrows
He crouched he lay down like a lion and like a lioness who will rouse him up Blessed are those who bless you and cursed are those who curse you
And Balak s anger was kindled against Balaam and he struck his hands together And Balak said to Balaam I called you to curse my enemies and behold you have blessed them these three times
Therefore now flee to your own place I said I will certainly honor you but the LORD has held you back from honor
And Balaam said to Balak Did I not tell your messengers whom you sent to me
If Balak should give me his house full of silver and gold I would not be able to go beyond the word of the LORD to do either good or bad of my own will What the LORD speaks that will I speak
And now behold I am going to my people Come I will let you know what this people will do to your people in the latter days
And he took up his discourse and said The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor the oracle of the man whose eye is opened
the oracle of him who hears the words of God and knows the knowledge of the Most High who sees the vision of the Almighty falling down with his eyes uncovered
I see him but not now I behold him but not near a star shall come out of Jacob and a scepter shall rise out of Israel it shall crush the forehead of Moab and break down all the sons of Sheth
Edom shall be dispossessed Seir also his enemies shall be dispossessed Israel is doing valiantly
And one from Jacob shall exercise dominion and destroy the survivors of cities
Then he looked on Amalek and took up his discourse and said Amalek was the first among the nations but its end is utter destruction
And he looked on the Kenite and took up his discourse and said Enduring is your dwelling place and your nest is set in the rock
Nevertheless Kain shall be burned when Asshur takes you away captive
And he took up his discourse and said Alas who shall live when God does this
But ships shall come from Kittim and shall afflict Asshur and Eber and he too shall come to utter destruction
Then Balaam rose and went back to his place And Balak also went his way
