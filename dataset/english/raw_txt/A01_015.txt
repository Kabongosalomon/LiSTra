Genesis 15
After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision Fear not Abram I am your shield your reward shall be very great
But Abram said O Lord GOD what will you give me for I continue childless and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus
And Abram said Behold you have given me no offspring and a member of my household will be my heir
And behold the word of the LORD came to him This man shall not be your heir your very own son shall be your heir
And he brought him outside and said Look toward heaven and number the stars if you are able to number them Then he said to him So shall your offspring be
And he believed the LORD and he counted it to him as righteousness
And he said to him I am the LORD who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess
But he said O Lord GOD how am I to know that I shall possess it
He said to him Bring me a heifer three years old a female goat three years old a ram three years old a turtledove and a young pigeon
And he brought him all these cut them in half and laid each half over against the other But he did not cut the birds in half
And when birds of prey came down on the carcasses Abram drove them away
As the sun was going down a deep sleep fell on Abram And behold dreadful and great darkness fell upon him
Then the LORD said to Abram Know for certain that your offspring will be sojourners in a land that is not theirs and will be servants there and they will be afflicted for four hundred years
But I will bring judgment on the nation that they serve and afterward they shall come out with great possessions
As for yourself you shall go to your fathers in peace you shall be buried in a good old age
And they shall come back here in the fourth generation for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete
When the sun had gone down and it was dark behold a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these pieces
On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram saying To your offspring I give this land from the river of Egypt to the great river the river Euphrates
the land of the Kenites the Kenizzites the Kadmonites
the Hittites the Perizzites the Rephaim
the Amorites the Canaanites the Girgashites and the Jebusites
