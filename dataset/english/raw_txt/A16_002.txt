Nehemiah 2
In the month of Nisan in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes when wine was before him I took up the wine and gave it to the king Now I had not been sad in his presence
And the king said to me Why is your face sad seeing you are not sick This is nothing but sadness of the heart Then I was very much afraid
I said to the king Let the king live forever Why should not my face be sad when the city the place of my fathers graves lies in ruins and its gates have been destroyed by fire
Then the king said to me What are you requesting So I prayed to the God of heaven
And I said to the king If it pleases the king and if your servant has found favor in your sight that you send me to Judah to the city of my fathers graves that I may rebuild it
And the king said to me the queen sitting beside him How long will you be gone and when will you return So it pleased the king to send me when I had given him a time
And I said to the king If it pleases the king let letters be given me to the governors of the province Beyond the River that they may let me pass through until I come to Judah
and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king s forest that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress of the temple and for the wall of the city and for the house that I shall occupy And the king granted me what I asked for the good hand of my God was upon me
Then I came to the governors of the province Beyond the River and gave them the king s letters Now the king had sent with me officers of the army and horsemen
But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite servant heard this it displeased them greatly that someone had come to seek the welfare of the people of Israel
So I went to Jerusalem and was there three days
Then I arose in the night I and a few men with me And I told no one what my God had put into my heart to do for Jerusalem There was no animal with me but the one on which I rode
I went out by night by the Valley Gate to the Dragon Spring and to the Dung Gate and I inspected the walls of Jerusalem that were broken down and its gates that had been destroyed by fire
Then I went on to the Fountain Gate and to the King s Pool but there was no room for the animal that was under me to pass
Then I went up in the night by the valley and inspected the wall and I turned back and entered by the Valley Gate and so returned
And the officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing and I had not yet told the Jews the priests the nobles the officials and the rest who were to do the work
Then I said to them You see the trouble we are in how Jerusalem lies in ruins with its gates burned Come let us build the wall of Jerusalem that we may no longer suffer derision
And I told them of the hand of my God that had been upon me for good and also of the words that the king had spoken to me And they said Let us rise up and build So they strengthened their hands for the good work
But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite servant and Geshem the Arab heard of it they jeered at us and despised us and said What is this thing that you are doing Are you rebelling against the king
Then I replied to them The God of heaven will make us prosper and we his servants will arise and build but you have no portion or right or claim in Jerusalem
