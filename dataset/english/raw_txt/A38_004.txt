Zechariah 4
And the angel who talked with me came again and woke me like a man who is awakened out of his sleep
And he said to me What do you see I said I see and behold a lampstand all of gold with a bowl on the top of it and seven lamps on it with seven lips on each of the lamps that are on the top of it
And there are two olive trees by it one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left
And I said to the angel who talked with me What are these my lord
Then the angel who talked with me answered and said to me Do you not know what these are I said No my lord
Then he said to me This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel Not by might nor by power but by my Spirit says the LORD of hosts
Who are you O great mountain Before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain And he shall bring forward the top stone amid shouts of Grace grace to it
Then the word of the LORD came to me saying
The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also complete it Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you
For whoever has despised the day of small things shall rejoice and shall see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel These seven are the eyes of the LORD which range through the whole earth
Then I said to him What are these two olive trees on the right and the left of the lampstand
And a second time I answered and said to him What are these two branches of the olive trees which are beside the two golden pipes from which the golden oil is poured out
He said to me Do you not know what these are I said No my lord
Then he said These are the two anointed ones who stand by the Lord of the whole earth
