Daniel 3
King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold whose height was sixty cubits and its breadth six cubits He set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon
Then King Nebuchadnezzar sent to gather the satraps the prefects and the governors the counselors the treasurers the justices the magistrates and all the officials of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up
Then the satraps the prefects and the governors the counselors the treasurers the justices the magistrates and all the officials of the provinces gathered for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up And they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up
And the herald proclaimed aloud You are commanded O peoples nations and languages
that when you hear the sound of the horn pipe lyre trigon harp bagpipe and every kind of music you are to fall down and worship the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up
And whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace
Therefore as soon as all the peoples heard the sound of the horn pipe lyre trigon harp bagpipe and every kind of music all the peoples nations and languages fell down and worshiped the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up
Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came forward and maliciously accused the Jews
They declared to King Nebuchadnezzar O king live forever
You O king have made a decree that every man who hears the sound of the horn pipe lyre trigon harp bagpipe and every kind of music shall fall down and worship the golden image
And whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into a burning fiery furnace
There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon Shadrach Meshach and Abednego These men O king pay no attention to you they do not serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up
Then Nebuchadnezzar in furious rage commanded that Shadrach Meshach and Abednego be brought So they brought these men before the king
Nebuchadnezzar answered and said to them Is it true O Shadrach Meshach and Abednego that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image that I have set up
Now if you are ready when you hear the sound of the horn pipe lyre trigon harp bagpipe and every kind of music to fall down and worship the image that I have made well and good But if you do not worship you shall immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace And who is the god who will deliver you out of my hands
Shadrach Meshach and Abednego answered and said to the king O Nebuchadnezzar we have no need to answer you in this matter
If this be so our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of your hand O king
But if not be it known to you O king that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up
Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with fury and the expression of his face was changed against Shadrach Meshach and Abednego He ordered the furnace heated seven times more than it was usually heated
And he ordered some of the mighty men of his army to bind Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace
Then these men were bound in their cloaks their tunics their hats and their other garments and they were thrown into the burning fiery furnace
Because the king s order was urgent and the furnace overheated the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
And these three men Shadrach Meshach and Abednego fell bound into the burning fiery furnace
Then King Nebuchadnezzar was astonished and rose up in haste He declared to his counselors Did we not cast three men bound into the fire They answered and said to the king True O king
He answered and said But I see four men unbound walking in the midst of the fire and they are not hurt and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods
Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the door of the burning fiery furnace he declared Shadrach Meshach and Abednego servants of the Most High God come out and come here Then Shadrach Meshach and Abednego came out from the fire
And the satraps the prefects the governors and the king s counselors gathered together and saw that the fire had not had any power over the bodies of those men The hair of their heads was not singed their cloaks were not harmed and no smell of fire had come upon them
Nebuchadnezzar answered and said Blessed be the God of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego who has sent his angel and delivered his servants who trusted in him and set aside the king s command and yielded up their bodies rather than serve and worship any god except their own God
Therefore I make a decree Any people nation or language that speaks anything against the God of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego shall be torn limb from limb and their houses laid in ruins for there is no other god who is able to rescue in this way
Then the king promoted Shadrach Meshach and Abednego in the province of Babylon
