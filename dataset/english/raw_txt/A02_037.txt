Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood Two cubits and a half was its length a cubit and a half its breadth and a cubit and a half its height
And he overlaid it with pure gold inside and outside and made a molding of gold around it
And he cast for it four rings of gold for its four feet two rings on its one side and two rings on its other side
And he made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold
and put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark to carry the ark
And he made a mercy seat of pure gold Two cubits and a half was its length and a cubit and a half its breadth
And he made two cherubim of gold He made them of hammered work on the two ends of the mercy seat
one cherub on the one end and one cherub on the other end Of one piece with the mercy seat he made the cherubim on its two ends
The cherubim spread out their wings above overshadowing the mercy seat with their wings with their faces one to another toward the mercy seat were the faces of the cherubim

He cast for it four rings of gold and fastened the rings to the four corners at its four legs
