Jeremiah 39
In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah in the tenth month Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem and besieged it
In the eleventh year of Zedekiah in the fourth month on the ninth day of the month a breach was made in the city
Then all the officials of the king of Babylon came and sat in the middle gate Nergal sar ezer Samgar nebu Sar sekim the Rab saris Nergal sar ezer the Rab mag with all the rest of the officers of the king of Babylon
When Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers saw them they fled going out of the city at night by way of the king s garden through the gate between the two walls and they went toward the Arabah
But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho And when they had taken him they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath and he passed sentence on him
The king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah at Riblah before his eyes and the king of Babylon slaughtered all the nobles of Judah
He put out the eyes of Zedekiah and bound him in chains to take him to Babylon
The Chaldeans burned the king s house and the house of the people and broke down the walls of Jerusalem
Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried into exile to Babylon the rest of the people who were left in the city those who had deserted to him and the people who remained
Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left in the land of Judah some of the poor people who owned nothing and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave command concerning Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard saying
Take him look after him well and do him no harm but deal with him as he tells you
So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard Nebushazban the Rab saris Nergal sar ezer the Rab mag and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon
sent and took Jeremiah from the court of the guard They entrusted him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam son of Shaphan that he should take him home So he lived among the people
The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah while he was shut up in the court of the guard
Go and say to Ebed melech the Ethiopian Thus says the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Behold I will fulfill my words against this city for harm and not for good and they shall be accomplished before you on that day
But I will deliver you on that day declares the LORD and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid
For I will surely save you and you shall not fall by the sword but you shall have your life as a prize of war because you have put your trust in me declares the LORD
