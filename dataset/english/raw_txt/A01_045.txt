Genesis 45
Then Joseph could not control himself before all those who stood by him He cried Make everyone go out from me So no one stayed with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers
And he wept aloud so that the Egyptians heard it and the household of Pharaoh heard it
And Joseph said to his brothers I am Joseph Is my father still alive But his brothers could not answer him for they were dismayed at his presence
So Joseph said to his brothers Come near to me please And they came near And he said I am your brother Joseph whom you sold into Egypt
And now do not be distressed or angry with yourselves because you sold me here for God sent me before you to preserve life
For the famine has been in the land these two years and there are yet five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest
And God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant on earth and to keep alive for you many survivors
So it was not you who sent me here but God He has made me a father to Pharaoh and lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of Egypt
Hurry and go up to my father and say to him Thus says your son Joseph God has made me lord of all Egypt Come down to me do not tarry
You shall dwell in the land of Goshen and you shall be near me you and your children and your children s children and your flocks your herds and all that you have
There I will provide for you for there are yet five years of famine to come so that you and your household and all that you have do not come to poverty
And now your eyes see and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see that it is my mouth that speaks to you
You must tell my father of all my honor in Egypt and of all that you have seen Hurry and bring my father down here
Then he fell upon his brother Benjamin s neck and wept and Benjamin wept upon his neck
And he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them After that his brothers talked with him
When the report was heard in Pharaoh s house Joseph s brothers have come it pleased Pharaoh and his servants
And Pharaoh said to Joseph Say to your brothers Do this load your beasts and go back to the land of Canaan
and take your father and your households and come to me and I will give you the best of the land of Egypt and you shall eat the fat of the land
And you Joseph are commanded to say Do this take wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives and bring your father and come
Have no concern for your goods for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours
The sons of Israel did so and Joseph gave them wagons according to the command of Pharaoh and gave them provisions for the journey
To each and all of them he gave a change of clothes but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels of silver and five changes of clothes
To his father he sent as follows ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt and ten female donkeys loaded with grain bread and provision for his father on the journey
Then he sent his brothers away and as they departed he said to them Do not quarrel on the way
So they went up out of Egypt and came to the land of Canaan to their father Jacob
And they told him Joseph is still alive and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt And his heart became numb for he did not believe them
But when they told him all the words of Joseph which he had said to them and when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to carry him the spirit of their father Jacob revived
And Israel said It is enough Joseph my son is still alive I will go and see him before I die
