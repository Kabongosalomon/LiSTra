Acts 11
Now the apostles and the brothers who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God
So when Peter went up to Jerusalem the circumcision party criticized him saying
You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them
But Peter began and explained it to them in order
I was in the city of Joppa praying and in a trance I saw a vision something like a great sheet descending being let down from heaven by its four corners and it came down to me
Looking at it closely I observed animals and beasts of prey and reptiles and birds of the air
And I heard a voice saying to me Rise Peter kill and eat
But I said By no means Lord for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth
But the voice answered a second time from heaven What God has made clean do not call common
This happened three times and all was drawn up again into heaven
And behold at that very moment three men arrived at the house in which we were sent to me from Caesarea
And the Spirit told me to go with them making no distinction These six brothers also accompanied me and we entered the man s house
And he told us how he had seen the angel stand in his house and say Send to Joppa and bring Simon who is called Peter
he will declare to you a message by which you will be saved you and all your household
As I began to speak the Holy Spirit fell on them just as on us at the beginning
And I remembered the word of the Lord how he said John baptized with water but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit
If then God gave the same gift to them as he gave to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ who was I that I could stand in God s way
When they heard these things they fell silent And they glorified God saying Then to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance that leads to life
Now those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch speaking the word to no one except Jews
But there were some of them men of Cyprus and Cyrene who on coming to Antioch spoke to the Hellenists also preaching the Lord Jesus
And the hand of the Lord was with them and a great number who believed turned to the Lord
The report of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem and they sent Barnabas to Antioch
When he came and saw the grace of God he was glad and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast purpose
for he was a good man full of the Holy Spirit and of faith And a great many people were added to the Lord
So Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul
and when he had found him he brought him to Antioch For a whole year they met with the church and taught a great many people And in Antioch the disciples were first called Christians
Now in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch
And one of them named Agabus stood up and foretold by the Spirit that there would be a great famine over all the world this took place in the days of Claudius
So the disciples determined everyone according to his ability to send relief to the brothers living in Judea
And they did so sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul
