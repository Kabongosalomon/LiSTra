Mark 6
He went away from there and came to his hometown and his disciples followed him
And on the Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue and many who heard him were astonished saying Where did this man get these things What is the wisdom given to him How are such mighty works done by his hands
Is not this the carpenter the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon And are not his sisters here with us And they took offense at him
And Jesus said to them A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and among his relatives and in his own household
And he could do no mighty work there except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them
And he marveled because of their unbelief And he went about among the villages teaching
And he called the twelve and began to send them out two by two and gave them authority over the unclean spirits
He charged them to take nothing for their journey except a staff no bread no bag no money in their belts
but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics
And he said to them Whenever you enter a house stay there until you depart from there
And if any place will not receive you and they will not listen to you when you leave shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them
So they went out and proclaimed that people should repent
And they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many who were sick and healed them
King Herod heard of it for Jesus name had become known Some said John the Baptist has been raised from the dead That is why these miraculous powers are at work in him
But others said He is Elijah And others said He is a prophet like one of the prophets of old
But when Herod heard of it he said John whom I beheaded has been raised
For it was Herod who had sent and seized John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias his brother Philip s wife because he had married her
For John had been saying to Herod It is not lawful for you to have your brother s wife
And Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death But she could not
for Herod feared John knowing that he was a righteous and holy man and he kept him safe When he heard him he was greatly perplexed and yet he heard him gladly
But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee
For when Herodias s daughter came in and danced she pleased Herod and his guests And the king said to the girl Ask me for whatever you wish and I will give it to you
And he vowed to her Whatever you ask me I will give you up to half of my kingdom
And she went out and said to her mother For what should I ask And she said The head of John the Baptist
And she came in immediately with haste to the king and asked saying I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter
And the king was exceedingly sorry but because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to break his word to her
And immediately the king sent an executioner with orders to bring John s head He went and beheaded him in the prison
and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl and the girl gave it to her mother
When his disciples heard of it they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb
The apostles returned to Jesus and told him all that they had done and taught
And he said to them Come away by yourselves to a desolate place and rest a while For many were coming and going and they had no leisure even to eat
And they went away in the boat to a desolate place by themselves
Now many saw them going and recognized them and they ran there on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them
When he went ashore he saw a great crowd and he had compassion on them because they were like sheep without a shepherd And he began to teach them many things
And when it grew late his disciples came to him and said This is a desolate place and the hour is now late
Send them away to go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat
But he answered them You give them something to eat And they said to him Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat
And he said to them How many loaves do you have Go and see And when they had found out they said Five and two fish
Then he commanded them all to sit down in groups on the green grass
So they sat down in groups by hundreds and by fifties
And taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven and said a blessing and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the people And he divided the two fish among them all
And they all ate and were satisfied
And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish
And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men
Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side to Bethsaida while he dismissed the crowd
And after he had taken leave of them he went up on the mountain to pray
And when evening came the boat was out on the sea and he was alone on the land
And he saw that they were making headway painfully for the wind was against them And about the fourth watch of the night he came to them walking on the sea He meant to pass by them
but when they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost and cried out
for they all saw him and were terrified But immediately he spoke to them and said Take heart it is I Do not be afraid
And he got into the boat with them and the wind ceased And they were utterly astounded
for they did not understand about the loaves but their hearts were hardened
When they had crossed over they came to land at Gennesaret and moored to the shore
And when they got out of the boat the people immediately recognized him
and ran about the whole region and began to bring the sick people on their beds to wherever they heard he was
And wherever he came in villages cities or countryside they laid the sick in the marketplaces and implored him that they might touch even the fringe of his garment And as many as touched it were made well
