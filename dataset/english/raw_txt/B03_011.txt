Luke 11
Now Jesus was praying in a certain place and when he finished one of his disciples said to him Lord teach us to pray as John taught his disciples
And he said to them When you pray say Father hallowed be your name Your kingdom come
Give us each day our daily bread
and forgive us our sins for we ourselves forgive everyone who is indebted to us And lead us not into temptation
And he said to them Which of you who has a friend will go to him at midnight and say to him Friend lend me three loaves
for a friend of mine has arrived on a journey and I have nothing to set before him
and he will answer from within Do not bother me the door is now shut and my children are with me in bed I cannot get up and give you anything
I tell you though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend yet because of his impudence he will rise and give him whatever he needs
And I tell you ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and it will be opened to you
For everyone who asks receives and the one who seeks finds and to the one who knocks it will be opened
What father among you if his son asks for a fish will instead of a fish give him a serpent
or if he asks for an egg will give him a scorpion
If you then who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him
Now he was casting out a demon that was mute When the demon had gone out the mute man spoke and the people marveled
But some of them said He casts out demons by Beelzebul the prince of demons
while others to test him kept seeking from him a sign from heaven
But he knowing their thoughts said to them Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste and a divided household falls
And if Satan also is divided against himself how will his kingdom stand For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul
And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul by whom do your sons cast them out Therefore they will be your judges
But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out demons then the kingdom of God has come upon you
When a strong man fully armed guards his own palace his goods are safe
but when one stronger than he attacks him and overcomes him he takes away his armor in which he trusted and divides his spoil
Whoever is not with me is against me and whoever does not gather with me scatters
When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person it passes through waterless places seeking rest and finding none it says I will return to my house from which I came
And when it comes it finds the house swept and put in order
Then it goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than itself and they enter and dwell there And the last state of that person is worse than the first
As he said these things a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him Blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts at which you nursed
But he said Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it
When the crowds were increasing he began to say This generation is an evil generation It seeks for a sign but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah
For as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh so will the Son of Man be to this generation
The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold something greater than Solomon is here
The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it for they repented at the preaching of Jonah and behold something greater than Jonah is here
No one after lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar or under a basket but on a stand so that those who enter may see the light
Your eye is the lamp of your body When your eye is healthy your whole body is full of light but when it is bad your body is full of darkness
Therefore be careful lest the light in you be darkness
If then your whole body is full of light having no part dark it will be wholly bright as when a lamp with its rays gives you light
While Jesus was speaking a Pharisee asked him to dine with him so he went in and reclined at table
The Pharisee was astonished to see that he did not first wash before dinner
And the Lord said to him Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish but inside you are full of greed and wickedness
You fools Did not he who made the outside make the inside also
But give as alms those things that are within and behold everything is clean for you
But woe to you Pharisees For you tithe mint and rue and every herb and neglect justice and the love of God These you ought to have done without neglecting the others
Woe to you Pharisees For you love the best seat in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces
Woe to you For you are like unmarked graves and people walk over them without knowing it
One of the lawyers answered him Teacher in saying these things you insult us also
And he said Woe to you lawyers also For you load people with burdens hard to bear and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers
Woe to you For you build the tombs of the prophets whom your fathers killed
So you are witnesses and you consent to the deeds of your fathers for they killed them and you build their tombs
Therefore also the Wisdom of God said I will send them prophets and apostles some of whom they will kill and persecute
so that the blood of all the prophets shed from the foundation of the world may be charged against this generation
from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah who perished between the altar and the sanctuary Yes I tell you it will be required of this generation
Woe to you lawyers For you have taken away the key of knowledge You did not enter yourselves and you hindered those who were entering
As he went away from there the scribes and the Pharisees began to press him hard and to provoke him to speak about many things
lying in wait for him to catch him in something he might say
