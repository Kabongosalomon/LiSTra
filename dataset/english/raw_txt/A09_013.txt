1 Samuel 13
Saul was years old when he began to reign and he reigned and two years over Israel
Saul chose three thousand men of Israel Two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and the hill country of Bethel and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin The rest of the people he sent home every man to his tent
Jonathan defeated the garrison of the Philistines that was at Geba and the Philistines heard of it And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land saying Let the Hebrews hear
And all Israel heard it said that Saul had defeated the garrison of the Philistines and also that Israel had become a stench to the Philistines And the people were called out to join Saul at Gilgal
And the Philistines mustered to fight with Israel thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and troops like the sand on the seashore in multitude They came up and encamped in Michmash to the east of Beth aven
When the men of Israel saw that they were in trouble for the people were hard pressed the people hid themselves in caves and in holes and in rocks and in tombs and in cisterns
and some Hebrews crossed the fords of the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead Saul was still at Gilgal and all the people followed him trembling
He waited seven days the time appointed by Samuel But Samuel did not come to Gilgal and the people were scattering from him
So Saul said Bring the burnt offering here to me and the peace offerings And he offered the burnt offering
As soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering behold Samuel came And Saul went out to meet him and greet him
Samuel said What have you done And Saul said When I saw that the people were scattering from me and that you did not come within the days appointed and that the Philistines had mustered at Michmash
I said Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal and I have not sought the favor of the LORD So I forced myself and offered the burnt offering
And Samuel said to Saul You have done foolishly You have not kept the command of the LORD your God with which he commanded you For then the LORD would have established your kingdom over Israel forever
But now your kingdom shall not continue The LORD has sought out a man after his own heart and the LORD has commanded him to be prince over his people because you have not kept what the LORD commanded you
And Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal The rest of the people went up after Saul to meet the army they went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin And Saul numbered the people who were present with him about six hundred men
And Saul and Jonathan his son and the people who were present with them stayed in Geba of Benjamin but the Philistines encamped in Michmash
And raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies One company turned toward Ophrah to the land of Shual
another company turned toward Beth horon and another company turned toward the border that looks down on the Valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness
Now there was no blacksmith to be found throughout all the land of Israel for the Philistines said Lest the Hebrews make themselves swords or spears
But every one of the Israelites went down to the Philistines to sharpen his plowshare his mattock his axe or his sickle
and the charge was two thirds of a shekel for the plowshares and for the mattocks and a third of a shekel for sharpening the axes and for setting the goads
So on the day of the battle there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people with Saul and Jonathan but Saul and Jonathan his son had them
And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash
