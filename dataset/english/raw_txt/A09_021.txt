1 Samuel 21
Then David came to Nob to Ahimelech the priest And Ahimelech came to meet David trembling and said to him Why are you alone and no one with you
And David said to Ahimelech the priest The king has charged me with a matter and said to me Let no one know anything of the matter about which I send you and with which I have charged you I have made an appointment with the young men for such and such a place
Now then what do you have on hand Give me five loaves of bread or whatever is here
And the priest answered David I have no common bread on hand but there is holy bread if the young men have kept themselves from women
And David answered the priest Truly women have been kept from us as always when I go on an expedition The vessels of the young men are holy even when it is an ordinary journey How much more today will their vessels be holy
So the priest gave him the holy bread for there was no bread there but the bread of the Presence which is removed from before the LORD to be replaced by hot bread on the day it is taken away
Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day detained before the LORD His name was Doeg the Edomite the chief of Saul s herdsmen
Then David said to Ahimelech Then have you not here a spear or a sword at hand For I have brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me because the king s business required haste
And the priest said The sword of Goliath the Philistine whom you struck down in the Valley of Elah behold it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod If you will take that take it for there is none but that here And David said There is none like that give it to me
And David rose and fled that day from Saul and went to Achish the king of Gath
And the servants of Achish said to him Is not this David the king of the land Did they not sing to one another of him in dances Saul has struck down his thousands and David his ten thousands
And David took these words to heart and was much afraid of Achish the king of Gath
So he changed his behavior before them and pretended to be insane in their hands and made marks on the doors of the gate and let his spittle run down his beard
Then Achish said to his servants Behold you see the man is mad Why then have you brought him to me
Do I lack madmen that you have brought this fellow to behave as a madman in my presence Shall this fellow come into my house
