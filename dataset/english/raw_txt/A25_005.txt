Lamentations 5
Remember O LORD what has befallen us look and see our disgrace
Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers our homes to foreigners
We have become orphans fatherless our mothers are like widows
We must pay for the water we drink the wood we get must be bought
Our pursuers are at our necks we are weary we are given no rest
We have given the hand to Egypt and to Assyria to get bread enough
Our fathers sinned and are no more and we bear their iniquities
Slaves rule over us there is none to deliver us from their hand
We get our bread at the peril of our lives because of the sword in the wilderness
Our skin is hot as an oven with the burning heat of famine
Women are raped in Zion young women in the towns of Judah
Princes are hung up by their hands no respect is shown to the elders
Young men are compelled to grind at the mill and boys stagger under loads of wood
The old men have left the city gate the young men their music
The joy of our hearts has ceased our dancing has been turned to mourning
The crown has fallen from our head woe to us for we have sinned
For this our heart has become sick for these things our eyes have grown dim
for Mount Zion which lies desolate jackals prowl over it
But you O LORD reign forever your throne endures to all generations
Why do you forget us forever why do you forsake us for so many days
Restore us to yourself O LORD that we may be restored Renew our days as of old
unless you have utterly rejected us and you remain exceedingly angry with us
