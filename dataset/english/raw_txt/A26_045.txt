Ezekiel 45
When you allot the land as an inheritance you shall set apart for the LORD a portion of the land as a holy district cubits long and cubits broad It shall be holy throughout its whole extent
Of this a square plot of by cubits shall be for the sanctuary with fifty cubits for an open space around it
And from this measured district you shall measure off a section cubits long and broad in which shall be the sanctuary the Most Holy Place
It shall be the holy portion of the land It shall be for the priests who minister in the sanctuary and approach the LORD to minister to him and it shall be a place for their houses and a holy place for the sanctuary
Another section cubits long and cubits broad shall be for the Levites who minister at the temple as their possession for cities to live in
Alongside the portion set apart as the holy district you shall assign for the property of the city an area cubits broad and cubits long It shall belong to the whole house of Israel
And to the prince shall belong the land on both sides of the holy district and the property of the city alongside the holy district and the property of the city on the west and on the east corresponding in length to one of the tribal portions and extending from the western to the eastern boundary
of the land It is to be his property in Israel And my princes shall no more oppress my people but they shall let the house of Israel have the land according to their tribes
Thus says the Lord GOD Enough O princes of Israel Put away violence and oppression and execute justice and righteousness Cease your evictions of my people declares the Lord GOD
You shall have just balances a just ephah and a just bath
The ephah and the bath shall be of the same measure the bath containing one tenth of a homer and the ephah one tenth of a homer the homer shall be the standard measure
The shekel shall be twenty gerahs twenty shekels plus twenty five shekels plus fifteen shekels shall be your mina
This is the offering that you shall make one sixth of an ephah from each homer of wheat and one sixth of an ephah from each homer of barley
and as the fixed portion of oil measured in baths one tenth of a bath from each cor the cor like the homer contains ten baths
And one sheep from every flock of two hundred from the watering places of Israel for grain offering burnt offering and peace offerings to make atonement for them declares the Lord GOD
All the people of the land shall be obliged to give this offering to the prince in Israel
It shall be the prince s duty to furnish the burnt offerings grain offerings and drink offerings at the feasts the new moons and the Sabbaths all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel he shall provide the sin offerings grain offerings burnt offerings and peace offerings to make atonement on behalf of the house of Israel
Thus says the Lord GOD In the first month on the first day of the month you shall take a bull from the herd without blemish and purify the sanctuary
The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the temple the four corners of the ledge of the altar and the posts of the gate of the inner court
You shall do the same on the seventh day of the month for anyone who has sinned through error or ignorance so you shall make atonement for the temple
In the first month on the fourteenth day of the month you shall celebrate the Feast of the Passover and for seven days unleavened bread shall be eaten
On that day the prince shall provide for himself and all the people of the land a young bull for a sin offering
And on the seven days of the festival he shall provide as a burnt offering to the LORD seven young bulls and seven rams without blemish on each of the seven days and a male goat daily for a sin offering
And he shall provide as a grain offering an ephah for each bull an ephah for each ram and a hin of oil to each ephah
In the seventh month on the fifteenth day of the month and for the seven days of the feast he shall make the same provision for sin offerings burnt offerings and grain offerings and for the oil
