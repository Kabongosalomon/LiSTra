Proverbs 20
Wine is a mocker strong drink a brawler and whoever is led astray by it is not wise
The terror of a king is like the growling of a lion whoever provokes him to anger forfeits his life
It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife but every fool will be quarreling
The sluggard does not plow in the autumn he will seek at harvest and have nothing
The purpose in a man s heart is like deep water but a man of understanding will draw it out
Many a man proclaims his own steadfast love but a faithful man who can find
The righteous who walks in his integrity blessed are his children after him
A king who sits on the throne of judgment winnows all evil with his eyes
Who can say I have made my heart pure I am clean from my sin
Unequal weights and unequal measures are both alike an abomination to the LORD
Even a child makes himself known by his acts by whether his conduct is pure and upright
The hearing ear and the seeing eye the LORD has made them both
Love not sleep lest you come to poverty open your eyes and you will have plenty of bread
Bad bad says the buyer but when he goes away then he boasts
There is gold and abundance of costly stones but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel
Take a man s garment when he has put up security for a stranger and hold it in pledge when he puts up security for foreigners
Bread gained by deceit is sweet to a man but afterward his mouth will be full of gravel
Plans are established by counsel by wise guidance wage war
Whoever goes about slandering reveals secrets therefore do not associate with a simple babbler
If one curses his father or his mother his lamp will be put out in utter darkness
An inheritance gained hastily in the beginning will not be blessed in the end
Do not say I will repay evil wait for the LORD and he will deliver you
Unequal weights are an abomination to the LORD and false scales are not good
A man s steps are from the LORD how then can man understand his way
It is a snare to say rashly It is holy and to reflect only after making vows
A wise king winnows the wicked and drives the wheel over them
The spirit of man is the lamp of the LORD searching all his innermost parts
Steadfast love and faithfulness preserve the king and by steadfast love his throne is upheld
The glory of young men is their strength but the splendor of old men is their gray hair
Blows that wound cleanse away evil strokes make clean the innermost parts
