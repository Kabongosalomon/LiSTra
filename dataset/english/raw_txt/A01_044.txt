Genesis 44
Then he commanded the steward of his house Fill the men s sacks with food as much as they can carry and put each man s money in the mouth of his sack
and put my cup the silver cup in the mouth of the sack of the youngest with his money for the grain And he did as Joseph told him
As soon as the morning was light the men were sent away with their donkeys
They had gone only a short distance from the city Now Joseph said to his steward Up follow after the men and when you overtake them say to them Why have you repaid evil for good
Is it not from this that my lord drinks and by this that he practices divination You have done evil in doing this
When he overtook them he spoke to them these words
They said to him Why does my lord speak such words as these Far be it from your servants to do such a thing
Behold the money that we found in the mouths of our sacks we brought back to you from the land of Canaan How then could we steal silver or gold from your lord s house
Whichever of your servants is found with it shall die and we also will be my lord s servants
He said Let it be as you say he who is found with it shall be my servant and the rest of you shall be innocent
Then each man quickly lowered his sack to the ground and each man opened his sack
And he searched beginning with the eldest and ending with the youngest And the cup was found in Benjamin s sack
Then they tore their clothes and every man loaded his donkey and they returned to the city
When Judah and his brothers came to Joseph s house he was still there They fell before him to the ground
Joseph said to them What deed is this that you have done Do you not know that a man like me can indeed practice divination
And Judah said What shall we say to my lord What shall we speak Or how can we clear ourselves God has found out the guilt of your servants behold we are my lord s servants both we and he also in whose hand the cup has been found
But he said Far be it from me that I should do so Only the man in whose hand the cup was found shall be my servant But as for you go up in peace to your father
Then Judah went up to him and said Oh my lord please let your servant speak a word in my lord s ears and let not your anger burn against your servant for you are like Pharaoh himself
My lord asked his servants saying Have you a father or a brother
And we said to my lord We have a father an old man and a young brother the child of his old age His brother is dead and he alone is left of his mother s children and his father loves him
Then you said to your servants Bring him down to me that I may set my eyes on him
We said to my lord The boy cannot leave his father for if he should leave his father his father would die
Then you said to your servants Unless your youngest brother comes down with you you shall not see my face again
When we went back to your servant my father we told him the words of my lord
And when our father said Go again buy us a little food
we said We cannot go down If our youngest brother goes with us then we will go down For we cannot see the man s face unless our youngest brother is with us
Then your servant my father said to us You know that my wife bore me two sons
One left me and I said Surely he has been torn to pieces and I have never seen him since
If you take this one also from me and harm happens to him you will bring down my gray hairs in evil to Sheol
Now therefore as soon as I come to your servant my father and the boy is not with us then as his life is bound up in the boy s life
as soon as he sees that the boy is not with us he will die and your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to Sheol
For your servant became a pledge of safety for the boy to my father saying If I do not bring him back to you then I shall bear the blame before my father all my life
Now therefore please let your servant remain instead of the boy as a servant to my lord and let the boy go back with his brothers
For how can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me I fear to see the evil that would find my father
