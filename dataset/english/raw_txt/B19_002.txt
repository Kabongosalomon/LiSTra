Hebrews 2
Therefore we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard lest we drift away from it
For since the message declared by angels proved to be reliable and every transgression or disobedience received a just retribution
how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation It was declared at first by the Lord and it was attested to us by those who heard
while God also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will
Now it was not to angels that God subjected the world to come of which we are speaking
It has been testified somewhere What is man that you are mindful of him or the son of man that you care for him
You made him for a little while lower than the angels you have crowned him with glory and honor
putting everything in subjection under his feet Now in putting everything in subjection to him he left nothing outside his control At present we do not yet see everything in subjection to him
But we see him who for a little while was made lower than the angels namely Jesus crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone
For it was fitting that he for whom and by whom all things exist in bringing many sons to glory should make the founder of their salvation perfect through suffering
For he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one source That is why he is not ashamed to call them brothers
saying I will tell of your name to my brothers in the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise
And again I will put my trust in him And again Behold I and the children God has given me
Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood he himself likewise partook of the same things that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death that is the devil
and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery
For surely it is not angels that he helps but he helps the offspring of Abraham
Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God to make propitiation for the sins of the people
For because he himself has suffered when tempted he is able to help those who are being tempted
