1 Corienthians 11
Be imitators of me as I am of Christ
Now I commend you because you remember me in everything and maintain the traditions even as I delivered them to you
But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ the head of a wife is her husband and the head of Christ is God
Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head
but every wife who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head since it is the same as if her head were shaven
For if a wife will not cover her head then she should cut her hair short But since it is disgraceful for a wife to cut off her hair or shave her head let her cover her head
For a man ought not to cover his head since he is the image and glory of God but woman is the glory of man
For man was not made from woman but woman from man
Neither was man created for woman but woman for man
That is why a wife ought to have a symbol of authority on her head because of the angels
Nevertheless in the Lord woman is not independent of man nor man of woman
for as woman was made from man so man is now born of woman And all things are from God
Judge for yourselves is it proper for a wife to pray to God with her head uncovered
Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair it is a disgrace for him
but if a woman has long hair it is her glory For her hair is given to her for a covering
If anyone is inclined to be contentious we have no such practice nor do the churches of God
But in the following instructions I do not commend you because when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse
For in the first place when you come together as a church I hear that there are divisions among you And I believe it in part
for there must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized
When you come together it is not the Lord s supper that you eat
For in eating each one goes ahead with his own meal One goes hungry another gets drunk
What Do you not have houses to eat and drink in Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing What shall I say to you Shall I commend you in this No I will not
For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread
and when he had given thanks he broke it and said This is my body which is for you Do this in remembrance of me
In the same way also he took the cup after supper saying This cup is the new covenant in my blood Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me
For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup you proclaim the Lord s death until he comes
Whoever therefore eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord
Let a person examine himself then and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup
For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself
That is why many of you are weak and ill and some have died
But if we judged ourselves truly we would not be judged
But when we are judged by the Lord we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world
So then my brothers when you come together to eat wait for one another
if anyone is hungry let him eat at home so that when you come together it will not be for judgment About the other things I will give directions when I come
