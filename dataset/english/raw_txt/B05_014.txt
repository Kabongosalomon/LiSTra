Acts 14
Now at Iconium they entered together into the Jewish synagogue and spoke in such a way that a great number of both Jews and Greeks believed
But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers
So they remained for a long time speaking boldly for the Lord who bore witness to the word of his grace granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands
But the people of the city were divided some sided with the Jews and some with the apostles
When an attempt was made by both Gentiles and Jews with their rulers to mistreat them and to stone them
they learned of it and fled to Lystra and Derbe cities of Lycaonia and to the surrounding country
and there they continued to preach the gospel
Now at Lystra there was a man sitting who could not use his feet He was crippled from birth and had never walked
He listened to Paul speaking And Paul looking intently at him and seeing that he had faith to be made well
said in a loud voice Stand upright on your feet And he sprang up and began walking
And when the crowds saw what Paul had done they lifted up their voices saying in Lycaonian The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men
Barnabas they called Zeus and Paul Hermes because he was the chief speaker
And the priest of Zeus whose temple was at the entrance to the city brought oxen and garlands to the gates and wanted to offer sacrifice with the crowds
But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it they tore their garments and rushed out into the crowd crying out
Men why are you doing these things We also are men of like nature with you and we bring you good news that you should turn from these vain things to a living God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them
In past generations he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways
Yet he did not leave himself without witness for he did good by giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons satisfying your hearts with food and gladness
Even with these words they scarcely restrained the people from offering sacrifice to them
But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and having persuaded the crowds they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city supposing that he was dead
But when the disciples gathered about him he rose up and entered the city and on the next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe
When they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch
strengthening the souls of the disciples encouraging them to continue in the faith and saying that through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God
And when they had appointed elders for them in every church with prayer and fasting they committed them to the Lord in whom they had believed
Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia
And when they had spoken the word in Perga they went down to Attalia
and from there they sailed to Antioch where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work that they had fulfilled
And when they arrived and gathered the church together they declared all that God had done with them and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles
And they remained no little time with the disciples
