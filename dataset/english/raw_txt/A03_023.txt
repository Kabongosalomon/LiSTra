and he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD so that you may be accepted On the day after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it
And on the day when you wave the sheaf you shall offer a male lamb a year old without blemish as a burnt offering to the LORD
And the grain offering with it shall be two tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil a food offering to the LORD with a pleasing aroma and the drink offering with it shall be of wine a fourth of a hin

And you shall not do any work on that very day for it is a Day of Atonement to make atonement for you before the LORD your God
For whoever is not afflicted on that very day shall be cut off from his people
And whoever does any work on that very day that person I will destroy from among his people
