2 Chronicles 4
He made an altar of bronze twenty cubits long and twenty cubits wide and ten cubits high
Then he made the sea of cast metal It was round ten cubits from brim to brim and five cubits high and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference
Under it were figures of gourds for ten cubits compassing the sea all around The gourds were in two rows cast with it when it was cast
It stood on twelve oxen three facing north three facing west three facing south and three facing east The sea was set on them and all their rear parts were inward
Its thickness was a handbreadth And its brim was made like the brim of a cup like the flower of a lily It held baths
He also made ten basins in which to wash and set five on the south side and five on the north side In these they were to rinse off what was used for the burnt offering and the sea was for the priests to wash in
And he made ten golden lampstands as prescribed and set them in the temple five on the south side and five on the north
He also made ten tables and placed them in the temple five on the south side and five on the north And he made a hundred basins of gold
He made the court of the priests and the great court and doors for the court and overlaid their doors with bronze
And he set the sea at the southeast corner of the house
Hiram also made the pots the shovels and the basins So Hiram finished the work that he did for King Solomon on the house of God
the two pillars the bowls and the two capitals on the top of the pillars and the two latticeworks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars
and the pomegranates for the two latticeworks two rows of pomegranates for each latticework to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars
He made the stands also and the basins on the stands
and the one sea and the twelve oxen underneath it
The pots the shovels the forks and all the equipment for these Huram abi made of burnished bronze for King Solomon for the house of the LORD
In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah
Solomon made all these things in great quantities for the weight of the bronze was not sought
So Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of God the golden altar the tables for the bread of the Presence
the lampstands and their lamps of pure gold to burn before the inner sanctuary as prescribed
the flowers the lamps and the tongs of purest gold
the snuffers basins dishes for incense and fire pans of pure gold and the sockets of the temple for the inner doors to the Most Holy Place and for the doors of the nave of the temple were of gold
