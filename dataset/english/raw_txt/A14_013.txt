2 Chronicles 13
In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam Abijah began to reign over Judah
He reigned for three years in Jerusalem His mother s name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah Now there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam
Abijah went out to battle having an army of valiant men of war chosen men And Jeroboam drew up his line of battle against him with chosen mighty warriors
Then Abijah stood up on Mount Zemaraim that is in the hill country of Ephraim and said Hear me O Jeroboam and all Israel
Ought you not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingship over Israel forever to David and his sons by a covenant of salt
Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat a servant of Solomon the son of David rose up and rebelled against his lord
and certain worthless scoundrels gathered about him and defied Rehoboam the son of Solomon when Rehoboam was young and irresolute and could not withstand them
And now you think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David because you are a great multitude and have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made you for gods
Have you not driven out the priests of the LORD the sons of Aaron and the Levites and made priests for yourselves like the peoples of other lands Whoever comes for ordination with a young bull or seven rams becomes a priest of what are no gods
But as for us the LORD is our God and we have not forsaken him We have priests ministering to the LORD who are sons of Aaron and Levites for their service
They offer to the LORD every morning and every evening burnt offerings and incense of sweet spices set out the showbread on the table of pure gold and care for the golden lampstand that its lamps may burn every evening For we keep the charge of the LORD our God but you have forsaken him
Behold God is with us at our head and his priests with their battle trumpets to sound the call to battle against you O sons of Israel do not fight against the LORD the God of your fathers for you cannot succeed
Jeroboam had sent an ambush around to come upon them from behind Thus his troops were in front of Judah and the ambush was behind them
And when Judah looked behold the battle was in front of and behind them And they cried to the LORD and the priests blew the trumpets
Then the men of Judah raised the battle shout And when the men of Judah shouted God defeated Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah
The men of Israel fled before Judah and God gave them into their hand
Abijah and his people struck them with great force so there fell slain of Israel chosen men
Thus the men of Israel were subdued at that time and the men of Judah prevailed because they relied on the LORD the God of their fathers
And Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took cities from him Bethel with its villages and Jeshanah with its villages and Ephron with its villages
Jeroboam did not recover his power in the days of Abijah And the LORD struck him down and he died
But Abijah grew mighty And he took fourteen wives and had twenty two sons and sixteen daughters
The rest of the acts of Abijah his ways and his sayings are written in the story of the prophet Iddo
