Hebrews 3
Therefore holy brothers you who share in a heavenly calling consider Jesus the apostle and high priest of our confession
who was faithful to him who appointed him just as Moses also was faithful in all God s house
For Jesus has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses as much more glory as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself
For every house is built by someone but the builder of all things is God
Now Moses was faithful in all God s house as a servant to testify to the things that were to be spoken later
but Christ is faithful over God s house as a son And we are his house if indeed we hold fast our confidence and our boasting in our hope
Therefore as the Holy Spirit says Today if you hear his voice
do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion on the day of testing in the wilderness
where your fathers put me to the test and saw my works for forty years
Therefore I was provoked with that generation and said They always go astray in their heart they have not known my ways
As I swore in my wrath They shall not enter my rest
Take care brothers lest there be in any of you an evil unbelieving heart leading you to fall away from the living God
But exhort one another every day as long as it is called today that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin
For we have come to share in Christ if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end
As it is said Today if you hear his voice do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion
For who were those who heard and yet rebelled Was it not all those who left Egypt led by Moses
And with whom was he provoked for forty years Was it not with those who sinned whose bodies fell in the wilderness
And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest but to those who were disobedient
So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief
