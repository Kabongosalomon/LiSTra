Ruth 4
Now Boaz had gone up to the gate and sat down there And behold the redeemer of whom Boaz had spoken came by So Boaz said Turn aside friend sit down here And he turned aside and sat down
And he took ten men of the elders of the city and said Sit down here So they sat down
Then he said to the redeemer Naomi who has come back from the country of Moab is selling the parcel of land that belonged to our relative Elimelech
So I thought I would tell you of it and say Buy it in the presence of those sitting here and in the presence of the elders of my people If you will redeem it redeem it But if you will not tell me that I may know for there is no one besides you to redeem it and I come after you And he said I will redeem it
Then Boaz said The day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi you also acquire Ruth the Moabite the widow of the dead in order to perpetuate the name of the dead in his inheritance
Then the redeemer said I cannot redeem it for myself lest I impair my own inheritance Take my right of redemption yourself for I cannot redeem it
Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning redeeming and exchanging to confirm a transaction the one drew off his sandal and gave it to the other and this was the manner of attesting in Israel
So when the redeemer said to Boaz Buy it for yourself he drew off his sandal
Then Boaz said to the elders and all the people You are witnesses this day that I have bought from the hand of Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech and all that belonged to Chilion and to Mahlon
Also Ruth the Moabite the widow of Mahlon I have bought to be my wife to perpetuate the name of the dead in his inheritance that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brothers and from the gate of his native place You are witnesses this day
Then all the people who were at the gate and the elders said We are witnesses May the LORD make the woman who is coming into your house like Rachel and Leah who together built up the house of Israel May you act worthily in Ephrathah and be renowned in Bethlehem
and may your house be like the house of Perez whom Tamar bore to Judah because of the offspring that the LORD will give you by this young woman
So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife And he went in to her and the LORD gave her conception and she bore a son
Then the women said to Naomi Blessed be the LORD who has not left you this day without a redeemer and may his name be renowned in Israel
He shall be to you a restorer of life and a nourisher of your old age for your daughter in law who loves you who is more to you than seven sons has given birth to him
Then Naomi took the child and laid him on her lap and became his nurse
And the women of the neighborhood gave him a name saying A son has been born to Naomi They named him Obed He was the father of Jesse the father of David
Now these are the generations of Perez Perez fathered Hezron
Hezron fathered Ram Ram fathered Amminadab
Amminadab fathered Nahshon Nahshon fathered Salmon
Salmon fathered Boaz Boaz fathered Obed
Obed fathered Jesse and Jesse fathered David
