Proverbs 29
He who is often reproved yet stiffens his neck will suddenly be broken beyond healing
When the righteous increase the people rejoice but when the wicked rule the people groan
He who loves wisdom makes his father glad but a companion of prostitutes squanders his wealth
By justice a king builds up the land but he who exacts gifts tears it down
A man who flatters his neighbor spreads a net for his feet
An evil man is ensnared in his transgression but a righteous man sings and rejoices
A righteous man knows the rights of the poor a wicked man does not understand such knowledge
Scoffers set a city aflame but the wise turn away wrath
If a wise man has an argument with a fool the fool only rages and laughs and there is no quiet
Bloodthirsty men hate one who is blameless and seek the life of the upright
A fool gives full vent to his spirit but a wise man quietly holds it back
If a ruler listens to falsehood all his officials will be wicked
The poor man and the oppressor meet together the LORD gives light to the eyes of both
If a king faithfully judges the poor his throne will be established forever
The rod and reproof give wisdom but a child left to himself brings shame to his mother
When the wicked increase transgression increases but the righteous will look upon their downfall
Discipline your son and he will give you rest he will give delight to your heart
Where there is no prophetic vision the people cast off restraint but blessed is he who keeps the law
By mere words a servant is not disciplined for though he understands he will not respond
Do you see a man who is hasty in his words There is more hope for a fool than for him
Whoever pampers his servant from childhood will in the end find him his heir
A man of wrath stirs up strife and one given to anger causes much transgression
One s pride will bring him low but he who is lowly in spirit will obtain honor
The partner of a thief hates his own life he hears the curse but discloses nothing
The fear of man lays a snare but whoever trusts in the LORD is safe
Many seek the face of a ruler but it is from the LORD that a man gets justice
An unjust man is an abomination to the righteous but one whose way is straight is an abomination to the wicked
