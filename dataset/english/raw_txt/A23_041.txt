Isaiah 41
Listen to me in silence O coastlands let the peoples renew their strength let them approach then let them speak let us together draw near for judgment
Who stirred up one from the east whom victory meets at every step He gives up nations before him so that he tramples kings underfoot he makes them like dust with his sword like driven stubble with his bow
He pursues them and passes on safely by paths his feet have not trod
Who has performed and done this calling the generations from the beginning I the LORD the first and with the last I am he
The coastlands have seen and are afraid the ends of the earth tremble they have drawn near and come
Everyone helps his neighbor and says to his brother Be strong
The craftsman strengthens the goldsmith and he who smooths with the hammer him who strikes the anvil saying of the soldering It is good and they strengthen it with nails so that it cannot be moved
But you Israel my servant Jacob whom I have chosen the offspring of Abraham my friend
you whom I took from the ends of the earth and called from its farthest corners saying to you You are my servant I have chosen you and not cast you off
fear not for I am with you be not dismayed for I am your God I will strengthen you I will help you I will uphold you with my righteous right hand
Behold all who are incensed against you shall be put to shame and confounded those who strive against you shall be as nothing and shall perish
You shall seek those who contend with you but you shall not find them those who war against you shall be as nothing at all
For I the LORD your God hold your right hand it is I who say to you Fear not I am the one who helps you
Fear not you worm Jacob you men of Israel I am the one who helps you declares the LORD your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel
Behold I make of you a threshing sledge new sharp and having teeth you shall thresh the mountains and crush them and you shall make the hills like chaff
you shall winnow them and the wind shall carry them away and the tempest shall scatter them And you shall rejoice in the LORD in the Holy One of Israel you shall glory
When the poor and needy seek water and there is none and their tongue is parched with thirst I the LORD will answer them I the God of Israel will not forsake them
I will open rivers on the bare heights and fountains in the midst of the valleys I will make the wilderness a pool of water and the dry land springs of water
I will put in the wilderness the cedar the acacia the myrtle and the olive I will set in the desert the cypress the plane and the pine together
that they may see and know may consider and understand together that the hand of the LORD has done this the Holy One of Israel has created it
Set forth your case says the LORD bring your proofs says the King of Jacob
Let them bring them and tell us what is to happen Tell us the former things what they are that we may consider them that we may know their outcome or declare to us the things to come
Tell us what is to come hereafter that we may know that you are gods do good or do harm that we may be dismayed and terrified
Behold you are nothing and your work is less than nothing an abomination is he who chooses you
I stirred up one from the north and he has come from the rising of the sun and he shall call upon my name he shall trample on rulers as on mortar as the potter treads clay
Who declared it from the beginning that we might know and beforehand that we might say He is right There was none who declared it none who proclaimed none who heard your words
I was the first to say to Zion Behold here they are and I give to Jerusalem a herald of good news
But when I look there is no one among these there is no counselor who when I ask gives an answer
Behold they are all a delusion their works are nothing their metal images are empty wind
