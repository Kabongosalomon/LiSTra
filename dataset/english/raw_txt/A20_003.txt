Proverbs 3
My son do not forget my teaching but let your heart keep my commandments
for length of days and years of life and peace they will add to you
Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you bind them around your neck write them on the tablet of your heart
So you will find favor and good success in the sight of God and man
Trust in the LORD with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding
In all your ways acknowledge him and he will make straight your paths
Be not wise in your own eyes fear the LORD and turn away from evil
It will be healing to your flesh and refreshment to your bones
Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your produce
then your barns will be filled with plenty and your vats will be bursting with wine
My son do not despise the LORD s discipline or be weary of his reproof
for the LORD reproves him whom he loves as a father the son in whom he delights
Blessed is the one who finds wisdom and the one who gets understanding
for the gain from her is better than gain from silver and her profit better than gold
She is more precious than jewels and nothing you desire can compare with her
Long life is in her right hand in her left hand are riches and honor
Her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace
She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her those who hold her fast are called blessed
The LORD by wisdom founded the earth by understanding he established the heavens
by his knowledge the deeps broke open and the clouds drop down the dew
My son do not lose sight of these keep sound wisdom and discretion
and they will be life for your soul and adornment for your neck
Then you will walk on your way securely and your foot will not stumble
If you lie down you will not be afraid when you lie down your sleep will be sweet
Do not be afraid of sudden terror or of the ruin of the wicked when it comes
for the LORD will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being caught
Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due when it is in your power to do it
Do not say to your neighbor Go and come again tomorrow I will give it when you have it with you
Do not plan evil against your neighbor who dwells trustingly beside you
Do not contend with a man for no reason when he has done you no harm
Do not envy a man of violence and do not choose any of his ways
for the devious person is an abomination to the LORD but the upright are in his confidence
The LORD s curse is on the house of the wicked but he blesses the dwelling of the righteous
Toward the scorners he is scornful but to the humble he gives favor
The wise will inherit honor but fools get disgrace
