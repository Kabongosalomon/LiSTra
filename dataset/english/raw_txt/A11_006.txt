1 Kings 6
In the four hundred and eightieth year after the people of Israel came out of the land of Egypt in the fourth year of Solomon s reign over Israel in the month of Ziv which is the second month he began to build the house of the LORD
The house that King Solomon built for the LORD was sixty cubits long twenty cubits wide and thirty cubits high
The vestibule in front of the nave of the house was twenty cubits long equal to the width of the house and ten cubits deep in front of the house
And he made for the house windows with recessed frames
He also built a structure against the wall of the house running around the walls of the house both the nave and the inner sanctuary And he made side chambers all around
The lowest story was five cubits broad the middle one was six cubits broad and the third was seven cubits broad For around the outside of the house he made offsets on the wall in order that the supporting beams should not be inserted into the walls of the house
When the house was built it was with stone prepared at the quarry so that neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron was heard in the house while it was being built
The entrance for the lowest story was on the south side of the house and one went up by stairs to the middle story and from the middle story to the third
So he built the house and finished it and he made the ceiling of the house of beams and planks of cedar
He built the structure against the whole house five cubits high and it was joined to the house with timbers of cedar
Now the word of the LORD came to Solomon
Concerning this house that you are building if you will walk in my statutes and obey my rules and keep all my commandments and walk in them then I will establish my word with you which I spoke to David your father
And I will dwell among the children of Israel and will not forsake my people Israel
So Solomon built the house and finished it
He lined the walls of the house on the inside with boards of cedar From the floor of the house to the walls of the ceiling he covered them on the inside with wood and he covered the floor of the house with boards of cypress
He built twenty cubits of the rear of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the walls and he built this within as an inner sanctuary as the Most Holy Place
The house that is the nave in front of the inner sanctuary was forty cubits long
The cedar within the house was carved in the form of gourds and open flowers All was cedar no stone was seen
The inner sanctuary he prepared in the innermost part of the house to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD
The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long twenty cubits wide and twenty cubits high and he overlaid it with pure gold He also overlaid an altar of cedar
And Solomon overlaid the inside of the house with pure gold and he drew chains of gold across in front of the inner sanctuary and overlaid it with gold
And he overlaid the whole house with gold until all the house was finished Also the whole altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary he overlaid with gold
In the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim of olivewood each ten cubits high
Five cubits was the length of one wing of the cherub and five cubits the length of the other wing of the cherub it was ten cubits from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other
The other cherub also measured ten cubits both cherubim had the same measure and the same form
The height of one cherub was ten cubits and so was that of the other cherub
He put the cherubim in the innermost part of the house And the wings of the cherubim were spread out so that a wing of one touched the one wall and a wing of the other cherub touched the other wall their other wings touched each other in the middle of the house
And he overlaid the cherubim with gold
Around all the walls of the house he carved engraved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers in the inner and outer rooms
The floor of the house he overlaid with gold in the inner and outer rooms
For the entrance to the inner sanctuary he made doors of olivewood the lintel and the doorposts were five sided
He covered the two doors of olivewood with carvings of cherubim palm trees and open flowers He overlaid them with gold and spread gold on the cherubim and on the palm trees
So also he made for the entrance to the nave doorposts of olivewood in the form of a square
and two doors of cypress wood The two leaves of the one door were folding and the two leaves of the other door were folding
On them he carved cherubim and palm trees and open flowers and he overlaid them with gold evenly applied on the carved work
He built the inner court with three courses of cut stone and one course of cedar beams
In the fourth year the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid in the month of Ziv
And in the eleventh year in the month of Bul which is the eighth month the house was finished in all its parts and according to all its specifications He was seven years in building it
