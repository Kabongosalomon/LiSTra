Genesis 48
After this Joseph was told Behold your father is ill So he took with him his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim
And it was told to Jacob Your son Joseph has come to you Then Israel summoned his strength and sat up in bed
And Jacob said to Joseph God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me
and said to me Behold I will make you fruitful and multiply you and I will make of you a company of peoples and will give this land to your offspring after you for an everlasting possession
And now your two sons who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt are mine Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine as Reuben and Simeon are
And the children that you fathered after them shall be yours They shall be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance
As for me when I came from Paddan to my sorrow Rachel died in the land of Canaan on the way when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath that is Bethlehem
When Israel saw Joseph s sons he said Who are these
Joseph said to his father They are my sons whom God has given me here And he said Bring them to me please that I may bless them
Now the eyes of Israel were dim with age so that he could not see So Joseph brought them near him and he kissed them and embraced them
And Israel said to Joseph I never expected to see your face and behold God has let me see your offspring also
Then Joseph removed them from his knees and he bowed himself with his face to the earth
And Joseph took them both Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel s left hand and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel s right hand and brought them near him
And Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on the head of Ephraim who was the younger and his left hand on the head of Manasseh crossing his hands for Manasseh was the firstborn
And he blessed Joseph and said The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked the God who has been my shepherd all my life long to this day
the angel who has redeemed me from all evil bless the boys and in them let my name be carried on and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth
When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim it displeased him and he took his father s hand to move it from Ephraim s head to Manasseh s head
And Joseph said to his father Not this way my father since this one is the firstborn put your right hand on his head
But his father refused and said I know my son I know He also shall become a people and he also shall be great Nevertheless his younger brother shall be greater than he and his offspring shall become a multitude of nations
So he blessed them that day saying By you Israel will pronounce blessings saying God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh Thus he put Ephraim before Manasseh
Then Israel said to Joseph Behold I am about to die but God will be with you and will bring you again to the land of your fathers
Moreover I have given to you rather than to your brothers one mountain slope that I took from the hand of the Amorites with my sword and with my bow
