1 Corienthians 7
Now concerning the matters about which you wrote It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman
But because of the temptation to sexual immorality each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband
The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights and likewise the wife to her husband
For the wife does not have authority over her own body but the husband does Likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body but the wife does
Do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a limited time that you may devote yourselves to prayer but then come together again so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self control
Now as a concession not a command I say this
I wish that all were as I myself am But each has his own gift from God one of one kind and one of another
To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is good for them to remain single as I am
But if they cannot exercise self control they should marry For it is better to marry than to burn with passion
To the married I give this charge not I but the Lord the wife should not separate from her husband
but if she does she should remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband and the husband should not divorce his wife
To the rest I say I not the Lord that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever and she consents to live with him he should not divorce her
If any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever and he consents to live with her she should not divorce him
For the unbelieving husband is made holy because of his wife and the unbelieving wife is made holy because of her husband Otherwise your children would be unclean but as it is they are holy
But if the unbelieving partner separates let it be so In such cases the brother or sister is not enslaved God has called you to peace
For how do you know wife whether you will save your husband Or how do you know husband whether you will save your wife
Only let each person lead the life that the Lord has assigned to him and to which God has called him This is my rule in all the churches
Was anyone at the time of his call already circumcised Let him not seek to remove the marks of circumcision Was anyone at the time of his call uncircumcised Let him not seek circumcision
For neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision but keeping the commandments of God
Each one should remain in the condition in which he was called
Were you a slave when called Do not be concerned about it But if you can gain your freedom avail yourself of the opportunity
For he who was called in the Lord as a slave is a freedman of the Lord Likewise he who was free when called is a slave of Christ
You were bought with a price do not become slaves of men
So brothers in whatever condition each was called there let him remain with God
Now concerning the betrothed I have no command from the Lord but I give my judgment as one who by the Lord s mercy is trustworthy
I think that in view of the present distress it is good for a person to remain as he is
Are you bound to a wife Do not seek to be free Are you free from a wife Do not seek a wife
But if you do marry you have not sinned and if a betrothed woman marries she has not sinned Yet those who marry will have worldly troubles and I would spare you that
This is what I mean brothers the appointed time has grown very short From now on let those who have wives live as though they had none
and those who mourn as though they were not mourning and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing and those who buy as though they had no goods
and those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with it For the present form of this world is passing away
I want you to be free from anxieties The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord how to please the Lord
But the married man is anxious about worldly things how to please his wife
and his interests are divided And the unmarried or betrothed woman is anxious about the things of the Lord how to be holy in body and spirit But the married woman is anxious about worldly things how to please her husband
I say this for your own benefit not to lay any restraint upon you but to promote good order and to secure your undivided devotion to the Lord
If anyone thinks that he is not behaving properly toward his betrothed if his passions are strong and it has to be let him do as he wishes let them marry it is no sin
But whoever is firmly established in his heart being under no necessity but having his desire under control and has determined this in his heart to keep her as his betrothed he will do well
So then he who marries his betrothed does well and he who refrains from marriage will do even better
A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives But if her husband dies she is free to be married to whom she wishes only in the Lord
Yet in my judgment she is happier if she remains as she is And I think that I too have the Spirit of God
