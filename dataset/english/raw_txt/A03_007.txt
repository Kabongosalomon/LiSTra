Leviticus 7
This is the law of the guilt offering It is most holy
In the place where they kill the burnt offering they shall kill the guilt offering and its blood shall be thrown against the sides of the altar
And all its fat shall be offered the fat tail the fat that covers the entrails
the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins and the long lobe of the liver that he shall remove with the kidneys
The priest shall burn them on the altar as a food offering to the LORD it is a guilt offering
Every male among the priests may eat of it It shall be eaten in a holy place It is most holy
The guilt offering is just like the sin offering there is one law for them The priest who makes atonement with it shall have it
And the priest who offers any man s burnt offering shall have for himself the skin of the burnt offering that he has offered
And every grain offering baked in the oven and all that is prepared on a pan or a griddle shall belong to the priest who offers it
And every grain offering mixed with oil or dry shall be shared equally among all the sons of Aaron
And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings that one may offer to the LORD
If he offers it for a thanksgiving then he shall offer with the thanksgiving sacrifice unleavened loaves mixed with oil unleavened wafers smeared with oil and loaves of fine flour well mixed with oil
With the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving he shall bring his offering with loaves of leavened bread
And from it he shall offer one loaf from each offering as a gift to the LORD It shall belong to the priest who throws the blood of the peace offerings
And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his offering He shall not leave any of it until the morning
But if the sacrifice of his offering is a vow offering or a freewill offering it shall be eaten on the day that he offers his sacrifice and on the next day what remains of it shall be eaten
But what remains of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burned up with fire
If any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offering is eaten on the third day he who offers it shall not be accepted neither shall it be credited to him It is tainted and he who eats of it shall bear his iniquity
Flesh that touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten It shall be burned up with fire All who are clean may eat flesh
but the person who eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of the LORD s peace offerings while an uncleanness is on him that person shall be cut off from his people
And if anyone touches an unclean thing whether human uncleanness or an unclean beast or any unclean detestable creature and then eats some flesh from the sacrifice of the LORD s peace offerings that person shall be cut off from his people
The LORD spoke to Moses saying
Speak to the people of Israel saying You shall eat no fat of ox or sheep or goat
The fat of an animal that dies of itself and the fat of one that is torn by beasts may be put to any other use but on no account shall you eat it
For every person who eats of the fat of an animal of which a food offering may be made to the LORD shall be cut off from his people
Moreover you shall eat no blood whatever whether of fowl or of animal in any of your dwelling places
Whoever eats any blood that person shall be cut off from his people
The LORD spoke to Moses saying
Speak to the people of Israel saying Whoever offers the sacrifice of his peace offerings to the LORD shall bring his offering to the LORD from the sacrifice of his peace offerings
His own hands shall bring the LORD s food offerings He shall bring the fat with the breast that the breast may be waved as a wave offering before the LORD
The priest shall burn the fat on the altar but the breast shall be for Aaron and his sons
And the right thigh you shall give to the priest as a contribution from the sacrifice of your peace offerings
Whoever among the sons of Aaron offers the blood of the peace offerings and the fat shall have the right thigh for a portion
For the breast that is waved and the thigh that is contributed I have taken from the people of Israel out of the sacrifices of their peace offerings and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons as a perpetual due from the people of Israel
This is the portion of Aaron and of his sons from the LORD s food offerings from the day they were presented to serve as priests of the LORD
The LORD commanded this to be given them by the people of Israel from the day that he anointed them It is a perpetual due throughout their generations
This is the law of the burnt offering of the grain offering of the sin offering of the guilt offering of the ordination offering and of the peace offering
which the LORD commanded Moses on Mount Sinai on the day that he commanded the people of Israel to bring their offerings to the LORD in the wilderness of Sinai
