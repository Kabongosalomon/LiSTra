Mark 14
It was now two days before the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to arrest him by stealth and kill him
for they said Not during the feast lest there be an uproar from the people
And while he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper as he was reclining at table a woman came with an alabaster flask of ointment of pure nard very costly and she broke the flask and poured it over his head
There were some who said to themselves indignantly Why was the ointment wasted like that
For this ointment could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor And they scolded her
But Jesus said Leave her alone Why do you trouble her She has done a beautiful thing to me
For you always have the poor with you and whenever you want you can do good for them But you will not always have me
She has done what she could she has anointed my body beforehand for burial
And truly I say to you wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world what she has done will be told in memory of her
Then Judas Iscariot who was one of the twelve went to the chief priests in order to betray him to them
And when they heard it they were glad and promised to give him money And he sought an opportunity to betray him
And on the first day of Unleavened Bread when they sacrificed the Passover lamb his disciples said to him Where will you have us go and prepare for you to eat the Passover
And he sent two of his disciples and said to them Go into the city and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you Follow him
and wherever he enters say to the master of the house The Teacher says Where is my guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples
And he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready there prepare for us
And the disciples set out and went to the city and found it just as he had told them and they prepared the Passover
And when it was evening he came with the twelve
And as they were reclining at table and eating Jesus said Truly I say to you one of you will betray me one who is eating with me
They began to be sorrowful and to say to him one after another Is it I
He said to them It is one of the twelve one who is dipping bread into the dish with me
For the Son of Man goes as it is written of him but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed It would have been better for that man if he had not been born
And as they were eating he took bread and after blessing it broke it and gave it to them and said Take this is my body
And he took a cup and when he had given thanks he gave it to them and they all drank of it
And he said to them This is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many
Truly I say to you I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God
And when they had sung a hymn they went out to the Mount of Olives
And Jesus said to them You will all fall away for it is written I will strike the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered
But after I am raised up I will go before you to Galilee
Peter said to him Even though they all fall away I will not
And Jesus said to him Truly I tell you this very night before the rooster crows twice you will deny me three times
But he said emphatically If I must die with you I will not deny you And they all said the same
And they went to a place called Gethsemane And he said to his disciples Sit here while I pray
And he took with him Peter and James and John and began to be greatly distressed and troubled
And he said to them My soul is very sorrowful even to death Remain here and watch
And going a little farther he fell on the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him
And he said Abba Father all things are possible for you Remove this cup from me Yet not what I will but what you will
And he came and found them sleeping and he said to Peter Simon are you asleep Could you not watch one hour
Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation The spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak
And again he went away and prayed saying the same words
And again he came and found them sleeping for their eyes were very heavy and they did not know what to answer him
And he came the third time and said to them Are you still sleeping and taking your rest It is enough the hour has come The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners
Rise let us be going see my betrayer is at hand
And immediately while he was still speaking Judas came one of the twelve and with him a crowd with swords and clubs from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders
Now the betrayer had given them a sign saying The one I will kiss is the man Seize him and lead him away under guard
And when he came he went up to him at once and said Rabbi And he kissed him
And they laid hands on him and seized him
But one of those who stood by drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear
And Jesus said to them Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to capture me
Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching and you did not seize me But let the Scriptures be fulfilled
And they all left him and fled
And a young man followed him with nothing but a linen cloth about his body And they seized him
but he left the linen cloth and ran away naked
And they led Jesus to the high priest And all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes came together
And Peter had followed him at a distance right into the courtyard of the high priest And he was sitting with the guards and warming himself at the fire
Now the chief priests and the whole Council were seeking testimony against Jesus to put him to death but they found none
For many bore false witness against him but their testimony did not agree
And some stood up and bore false witness against him saying
We heard him say I will destroy this temple that is made with hands and in three days I will build another not made with hands
Yet even about this their testimony did not agree
And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus Have you no answer to make What is it that these men testify against you
But he remained silent and made no answer Again the high priest asked him Are you the Christ the Son of the Blessed
And Jesus said I am and you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming with the clouds of heaven
And the high priest tore his garments and said What further witnesses do we need
You have heard his blasphemy What is your decision And they all condemned him as deserving death
And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to strike him saying to him Prophesy And the guards received him with blows
And as Peter was below in the courtyard one of the servant girls of the high priest came
and seeing Peter warming himself she looked at him and said You also were with the Nazarene Jesus
But he denied it saying I neither know nor understand what you mean And he went out into the gateway and the rooster crowed
And the servant girl saw him and began again to say to the bystanders This man is one of them
But again he denied it And after a little while the bystanders again said to Peter Certainly you are one of them for you are a Galilean
But he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear I do not know this man of whom you speak
And immediately the rooster crowed a second time And Peter remembered how Jesus had said to him Before the rooster crows twice you will deny me three times And he broke down and wept
