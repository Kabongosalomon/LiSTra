Ecclesiastes 1
The words of the Preacher the son of David king in Jerusalem
Vanity of vanities says the Preacher vanity of vanities All is vanity
What does man gain by all the toil at which he toils under the sun
A generation goes and a generation comes but the earth remains forever
The sun rises and the sun goes down and hastens to the place where it rises
The wind blows to the south and goes around to the north around and around goes the wind and on its circuits the wind returns
All streams run to the sea but the sea is not full to the place where the streams flow there they flow again
All things are full of weariness a man cannot utter it the eye is not satisfied with seeing nor the ear filled with hearing
What has been is what will be and what has been done is what will be done and there is nothing new under the sun
Is there a thing of which it is said See this is new It has been already in the ages before us
There is no remembrance of former things nor will there be any remembrance of later things yet to be among those who come after
I the Preacher have been king over Israel in Jerusalem
And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom all that is done under heaven It is an unhappy business that God has given to the children of man to be busy with
I have seen everything that is done under the sun and behold all is vanity and a striving after wind
What is crooked cannot be made straight and what is lacking cannot be counted
I said in my heart I have acquired great wisdom surpassing all who were over Jerusalem before me and my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge
And I applied my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly I perceived that this also is but a striving after wind
For in much wisdom is much vexation and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow
