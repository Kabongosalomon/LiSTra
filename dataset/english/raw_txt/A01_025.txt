These are the days of the years of Abraham s life years

They settled from Havilah to Shur which is opposite Egypt in the direction of Assyria He settled over against all his kinsmen
These are the generations of Isaac Abraham s son Abraham fathered Isaac
and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan aram the sister of Laban the Aramean to be his wife
And Isaac prayed to the LORD for his wife because she was barren And the LORD granted his prayer and Rebekah his wife conceived
The children struggled together within her and she said If it is thus why is this happening to me So she went to inquire of the LORD
And the LORD said to her Two nations are in your womb and two peoples from within you shall be divided the one shall be stronger than the other the older shall serve the younger
When her days to give birth were completed behold there were twins in her womb
The first came out red all his body like a hairy cloak so they called his name Esau
Afterward his brother came out with his hand holding Esau s heel so his name was called Jacob Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them
When the boys grew up Esau was a skillful hunter a man of the field while Jacob was a quiet man dwelling in tents
Isaac loved Esau because he ate of his game but Rebekah loved Jacob
Once when Jacob was cooking stew Esau came in from the field and he was exhausted
And Esau said to Jacob Let me eat some of that red stew for I am exhausted Therefore his name was called Edom
Jacob said Sell me your birthright now
Esau said I am about to die of what use is a birthright to me
Jacob said Swear to me now So he swore to him and sold his birthright to Jacob
Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew and he ate and drank and rose and went his way Thus Esau despised his birthright
