Joshua 8
And the LORD said to Joshua Do not fear and do not be dismayed Take all the fighting men with you and arise go up to Ai See I have given into your hand the king of Ai and his people his city and his land
And you shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king Only its spoil and its livestock you shall take as plunder for yourselves Lay an ambush against the city behind it
So Joshua and all the fighting men arose to go up to Ai And Joshua chose mighty men of valor and sent them out by night
And he commanded them Behold you shall lie in ambush against the city behind it Do not go very far from the city but all of you remain ready
And I and all the people who are with me will approach the city And when they come out against us just as before we shall flee before them
And they will come out after us until we have drawn them away from the city For they will say They are fleeing from us just as before So we will flee before them
Then you shall rise up from the ambush and seize the city for the LORD your God will give it into your hand
And as soon as you have taken the city you shall set the city on fire You shall do according to the word of the LORD See I have commanded you
So Joshua sent them out And they went to the place of ambush and lay between Bethel and Ai to the west of Ai but Joshua spent that night among the people
Joshua arose early in the morning and mustered the people and went up he and the elders of Israel before the people to Ai
And all the fighting men who were with him went up and drew near before the city and encamped on the north side of Ai with a ravine between them and Ai
He took about men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai to the west of the city
So they stationed the forces the main encampment that was north of the city and its rear guard west of the city But Joshua spent that night in the valley
And as soon as the king of Ai saw this he and all his people the men of the city hurried and went out early to the appointed place toward the Arabah to meet Israel in battle But he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city
And Joshua and all Israel pretended to be beaten before them and fled in the direction of the wilderness
So all the people who were in the city were called together to pursue them and as they pursued Joshua they were drawn away from the city
Not a man was left in Ai or Bethel who did not go out after Israel They left the city open and pursued Israel
Then the LORD said to Joshua Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai for I will give it into your hand And Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city
And the men in the ambush rose quickly out of their place and as soon as he had stretched out his hand they ran and entered the city and captured it And they hurried to set the city on fire
So when the men of Ai looked back behold the smoke of the city went up to heaven and they had no power to flee this way or that for the people who fled to the wilderness turned back against the pursuers
And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had captured the city and that the smoke of the city went up then they turned back and struck down the men of Ai
And the others came out from the city against them so they were in the midst of Israel some on this side and some on that side And Israel struck them down until there was left none that survived or escaped
But the king of Ai they took alive and brought him near to Joshua
When Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the open wilderness where they pursued them and all of them to the very last had fallen by the edge of the sword all Israel returned to Ai and struck it down with the edge of the sword
And all who fell that day both men and women were all the people of Ai
But Joshua did not draw back his hand with which he stretched out the javelin until he had devoted all the inhabitants of Ai to destruction
Only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took as their plunder according to the word of the LORD that he commanded Joshua
So Joshua burned Ai and made it forever a heap of ruins as it is to this day
And he hanged the king of Ai on a tree until evening And at sunset Joshua commanded and they took his body down from the tree and threw it at the entrance of the gate of the city and raised over it a great heap of stones which stands there to this day
At that time Joshua built an altar to the LORD the God of Israel on Mount Ebal
just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the people of Israel as it is written in the Book of the Law of Moses an altar of uncut stones upon which no man has wielded an iron tool And they offered on it burnt offerings to the LORD and sacrificed peace offerings
And there in the presence of the people of Israel he wrote on the stones a copy of the law of Moses which he had written
And all Israel sojourner as well as native born with their elders and officers and their judges stood on opposite sides of the ark before the Levitical priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD half of them in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded at the first to bless the people of Israel
And afterward he read all the words of the law the blessing and the curse according to all that is written in the Book of the Law
There was not a word of all that Moses commanded that Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel and the women and the little ones and the sojourners who lived among them
