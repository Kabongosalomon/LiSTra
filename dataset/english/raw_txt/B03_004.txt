Luke 4
And Jesus full of the Holy Spirit returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness
for forty days being tempted by the devil And he ate nothing during those days And when they were ended he was hungry
The devil said to him If you are the Son of God command this stone to become bread
And Jesus answered him It is written Man shall not live by bread alone
And the devil took him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time
and said to him To you I will give all this authority and their glory for it has been delivered to me and I give it to whom I will
If you then will worship me it will all be yours
And Jesus answered him It is written You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve
And he took him to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him If you are the Son of God throw yourself down from here
for it is written He will command his angels concerning you to guard you
and On their hands they will bear you up lest you strike your foot against a stone
And Jesus answered him It is said You shall not put the Lord your God to the test
And when the devil had ended every temptation he departed from him until an opportune time
And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee and a report about him went out through all the surrounding country
And he taught in their synagogues being glorified by all
And he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up And as was his custom he went to the synagogue on the Sabbath day and he stood up to read
And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written
The Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty those who are oppressed
to proclaim the year of the Lord s favor
And he rolled up the scroll and gave it back to the attendant and sat down And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him
And he began to say to them Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing
And all spoke well of him and marveled at the gracious words that were coming from his mouth And they said Is not this Joseph s son
And he said to them Doubtless you will quote to me this proverb Physician heal yourself What we have heard you did at Capernaum do here in your hometown as well
And he said Truly I say to you no prophet is acceptable in his hometown
But in truth I tell you there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah when the heavens were shut up three years and six months and a great famine came over all the land
and Elijah was sent to none of them but only to Zarephath in the land of Sidon to a woman who was a widow
And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha and none of them was cleansed but only Naaman the Syrian
When they heard these things all in the synagogue were filled with wrath
And they rose up and drove him out of the town and brought him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built so that they could throw him down the cliff
But passing through their midst he went away
And he went down to Capernaum a city of Galilee And he was teaching them on the Sabbath
and they were astonished at his teaching for his word possessed authority
And in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon and he cried out with a loud voice
Ha What have you to do with us Jesus of Nazareth Have you come to destroy us I know who you are the Holy One of God
But Jesus rebuked him saying Be silent and come out of him And when the demon had thrown him down in their midst he came out of him having done him no harm
And they were all amazed and said to one another What is this word For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits and they come out
And reports about him went out into every place in the surrounding region
And he arose and left the synagogue and entered Simon s house Now Simon s mother in law was ill with a high fever and they appealed to him on her behalf
And he stood over her and rebuked the fever and it left her and immediately she rose and began to serve them
Now when the sun was setting all those who had any who were sick with various diseases brought them to him and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them
And demons also came out of many crying You are the Son of God But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak because they knew that he was the Christ
And when it was day he departed and went into a desolate place And the people sought him and came to him and would have kept him from leaving them
but he said to them I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns as well for I was sent for this purpose
And he was preaching in the synagogues of Judea
