Judges 5
Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day
That the leaders took the lead in Israel that the people offered themselves willingly bless the LORD
Hear O kings give ear O princes to the LORD I will sing I will make melody to the LORD the God of Israel
LORD when you went out from Seir when you marched from the region of Edom the earth trembled and the heavens dropped yes the clouds dropped water
The mountains quaked before the LORD even Sinai before the LORD the God of Israel
In the days of Shamgar son of Anath in the days of Jael the highways were abandoned and travelers kept to the byways
The villagers ceased in Israel they ceased to be until I arose I Deborah arose as a mother in Israel
When new gods were chosen then war was in the gates Was shield or spear to be seen among forty thousand in Israel
My heart goes out to the commanders of Israel who offered themselves willingly among the people Bless the LORD
Tell of it you who ride on white donkeys you who sit on rich carpets and you who walk by the way
To the sound of musicians at the watering places there they repeat the righteous triumphs of the LORD the righteous triumphs of his villagers in Israel Then down to the gates marched the people of the LORD
Awake awake Deborah Awake awake break out in a song Arise Barak lead away your captives O son of Abinoam
Then down marched the remnant of the noble the people of the LORD marched down for me against the mighty
From Ephraim their root they marched down into the valley following you Benjamin with your kinsmen from Machir marched down the commanders and from Zebulun those who bear the lieutenant s staff
the princes of Issachar came with Deborah and Issachar faithful to Barak into the valley they rushed at his heels Among the clans of Reuben there were great searchings of heart
Why did you sit still among the sheepfolds to hear the whistling for the flocks Among the clans of Reuben there were great searchings of heart
Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan and Dan why did he stay with the ships Asher sat still at the coast of the sea staying by his landings
Zebulun is a people who risked their lives to the death Naphtali too on the heights of the field
The kings came they fought then fought the kings of Canaan at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo they got no spoils of silver
From heaven the stars fought from their courses they fought against Sisera
The torrent Kishon swept them away the ancient torrent the torrent Kishon March on my soul with might
Then loud beat the horses hoofs with the galloping galloping of his steeds
Curse Meroz says the angel of the LORD curse its inhabitants thoroughly because they did not come to the help of the LORD to the help of the LORD against the mighty
Most blessed of women be Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite of tent dwelling women most blessed
He asked water and she gave him milk she brought him curds in a noble s bowl
She sent her hand to the tent peg and her right hand to the workmen s mallet she struck Sisera she crushed his head she shattered and pierced his temple
Between her feet he sank he fell he lay still between her feet he sank he fell where he sank there he fell dead
Out of the window she peered the mother of Sisera wailed through the lattice Why is his chariot so long in coming Why tarry the hoofbeats of his chariots
Her wisest princesses answer indeed she answers herself
Have they not found and divided the spoil A womb or two for every man spoil of dyed materials for Sisera spoil of dyed materials embroidered two pieces of dyed work embroidered for the neck as spoil
So may all your enemies perish O LORD But your friends be like the sun as he rises in his might And the land had rest for forty years
