Acts 9
But Saul still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord went to the high priest
and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus so that if he found any belonging to the Way men or women he might bring them bound to Jerusalem
Now as he went on his way he approached Damascus and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him
And falling to the ground he heard a voice saying to him Saul Saul why are you persecuting me
And he said Who are you Lord And he said I am Jesus whom you are persecuting
But rise and enter the city and you will be told what you are to do
The men who were traveling with him stood speechless hearing the voice but seeing no one
Saul rose from the ground and although his eyes were opened he saw nothing So they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus
And for three days he was without sight and neither ate nor drank
Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias The Lord said to him in a vision Ananias And he said Here I am Lord
And the Lord said to him Rise and go to the street called Straight and at the house of Judas look for a man of Tarsus named Saul for behold he is praying
and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight
But Ananias answered Lord I have heard from many about this man how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem
And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name
But the Lord said to him Go for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel
For I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name
So Ananias departed and entered the house And laying his hands on him he said Brother Saul the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you came has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit
And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes and he regained his sight Then he rose and was baptized
and taking food he was strengthened For some days he was with the disciples at Damascus
And immediately he proclaimed Jesus in the synagogues saying He is the Son of God
And all who heard him were amazed and said Is not this the man who made havoc in Jerusalem of those who called upon this name And has he not come here for this purpose to bring them bound before the chief priests
But Saul increased all the more in strength and confounded the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that Jesus was the Christ
When many days had passed the Jews plotted to kill him
but their plot became known to Saul They were watching the gates day and night in order to kill him
but his disciples took him by night and let him down through an opening in the wall lowering him in a basket
And when he had come to Jerusalem he attempted to join the disciples And they were all afraid of him for they did not believe that he was a disciple
But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and declared to them how on the road he had seen the Lord who spoke to him and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus
So he went in and out among them at Jerusalem preaching boldly in the name of the Lord
And he spoke and disputed against the Hellenists But they were seeking to kill him
And when the brothers learned this they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus
So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace and was being built up And walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit it multiplied
Now as Peter went here and there among them all he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda
There he found a man named Aeneas bedridden for eight years who was paralyzed
And Peter said to him Aeneas Jesus Christ heals you rise and make your bed And immediately he rose
And all the residents of Lydda and Sharon saw him and they turned to the Lord
Now there was in Joppa a disciple named Tabitha which translated means Dorcas She was full of good works and acts of charity
In those days she became ill and died and when they had washed her they laid her in an upper room
Since Lydda was near Joppa the disciples hearing that Peter was there sent two men to him urging him Please come to us without delay
So Peter rose and went with them And when he arrived they took him to the upper room All the widows stood beside him weeping and showing tunics and other garments that Dorcas made while she was with them
But Peter put them all outside and knelt down and prayed and turning to the body he said Tabitha arise And she opened her eyes and when she saw Peter she sat up
And he gave her his hand and raised her up Then calling the saints and widows he presented her alive
And it became known throughout all Joppa and many believed in the Lord
And he stayed in Joppa for many days with one Simon a tanner
