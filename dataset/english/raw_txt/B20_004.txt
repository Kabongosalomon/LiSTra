James 4
What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you Is it not this that your passions are at war within you
You desire and do not have so you murder You covet and cannot obtain so you fight and quarrel You do not have because you do not ask
You ask and do not receive because you ask wrongly to spend it on your passions
You adulterous people Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God
Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the Scripture says He yearns jealously over the spirit that he has made to dwell in us
But he gives more grace Therefore it says God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble
Submit yourselves therefore to God Resist the devil and he will flee from you
Draw near to God and he will draw near to you Cleanse your hands you sinners and purify your hearts you double minded
Be wretched and mourn and weep Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom
Humble yourselves before the Lord and he will exalt you
Do not speak evil against one another brothers The one who speaks against a brother or judges his brother speaks evil against the law and judges the law But if you judge the law you are not a doer of the law but a judge
There is only one lawgiver and judge he who is able to save and to destroy But who are you to judge your neighbor
Come now you who say Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a town and spend a year there and trade and make a profit
yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring What is your life For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes
Instead you ought to say If the Lord wills we will live and do this or that
As it is you boast in your arrogance All such boasting is evil
So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it for him it is sin
