Ezekiel 35
The word of the LORD came to me
Son of man set your face against Mount Seir and prophesy against it
and say to it Thus says the Lord GOD Behold I am against you Mount Seir and I will stretch out my hand against you and I will make you a desolation and a waste
I will lay your cities waste and you shall become a desolation and you shall know that I am the LORD
Because you cherished perpetual enmity and gave over the people of Israel to the power of the sword at the time of their calamity at the time of their final punishment
therefore as I live declares the Lord GOD I will prepare you for blood and blood shall pursue you because you did not hate bloodshed therefore blood shall pursue you
I will make Mount Seir a waste and a desolation and I will cut off from it all who come and go
And I will fill its mountains with the slain On your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines those slain with the sword shall fall
I will make you a perpetual desolation and your cities shall not be inhabited Then you will know that I am the LORD
Because you said These two nations and these two countries shall be mine and we will take possession of them although the LORD was there
therefore as I live declares the Lord GOD I will deal with you according to the anger and envy that you showed because of your hatred against them And I will make myself known among them when I judge you
And you shall know that I am the LORD I have heard all the revilings that you uttered against the mountains of Israel saying They are laid desolate they are given us to devour
And you magnified yourselves against me with your mouth and multiplied your words against me I heard it
Thus says the Lord GOD While the whole earth rejoices I will make you desolate
As you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel because it was desolate so I will deal with you you shall be desolate Mount Seir and all Edom all of it Then they will know that I am the LORD
