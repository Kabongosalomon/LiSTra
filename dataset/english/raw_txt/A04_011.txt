Numbers 11
And the people complained in the hearing of the LORD about their misfortunes and when the LORD heard it his anger was kindled and the fire of the LORD burned among them and consumed some outlying parts of the camp
Then the people cried out to Moses and Moses prayed to the LORD and the fire died down
So the name of that place was called Taberah because the fire of the LORD burned among them
Now the rabble that was among them had a strong craving And the people of Israel also wept again and said Oh that we had meat to eat
We remember the fish we ate in Egypt that cost nothing the cucumbers the melons the leeks the onions and the garlic
But now our strength is dried up and there is nothing at all but this manna to look at
Now the manna was like coriander seed and its appearance like that of bdellium
The people went about and gathered it and ground it in handmills or beat it in mortars and boiled it in pots and made cakes of it And the taste of it was like the taste of cakes baked with oil
When the dew fell upon the camp in the night the manna fell with it
Moses heard the people weeping throughout their clans everyone at the door of his tent And the anger of the LORD blazed hotly and Moses was displeased
Moses said to the LORD Why have you dealt ill with your servant And why have I not found favor in your sight that you lay the burden of all this people on me
Did I conceive all this people Did I give them birth that you should say to me Carry them in your bosom as a nurse carries a nursing child to the land that you swore to give their fathers
Where am I to get meat to give to all this people For they weep before me and say Give us meat that we may eat
I am not able to carry all this people alone the burden is too heavy for me
If you will treat me like this kill me at once if I find favor in your sight that I may not see my wretchedness
Then the LORD said to Moses Gather for me seventy men of the elders of Israel whom you know to be the elders of the people and officers over them and bring them to the tent of meeting and let them take their stand there with you
And I will come down and talk with you there And I will take some of the Spirit that is on you and put it on them and they shall bear the burden of the people with you so that you may not bear it yourself alone
And say to the people Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow and you shall eat meat for you have wept in the hearing of the LORD saying Who will give us meat to eat For it was better for us in Egypt Therefore the LORD will give you meat and you shall eat
You shall not eat just one day or two days or five days or ten days or twenty days
but a whole month until it comes out at your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you because you have rejected the LORD who is among you and have wept before him saying Why did we come out of Egypt
But Moses said The people among whom I am number six hundred thousand on foot and you have said I will give them meat that they may eat a whole month
Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them and be enough for them Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them and be enough for them
And the LORD said to Moses Is the LORD s hand shortened Now you shall see whether my word will come true for you or not
So Moses went out and told the people the words of the LORD And he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people and placed them around the tent
Then the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke to him and took some of the Spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy elders And as soon as the Spirit rested on them they prophesied But they did not continue doing it
Now two men remained in the camp one named Eldad and the other named Medad and the Spirit rested on them They were among those registered but they had not gone out to the tent and so they prophesied in the camp
And a young man ran and told Moses Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp
And Joshua the son of Nun the assistant of Moses from his youth said My lord Moses stop them
But Moses said to him Are you jealous for my sake Would that all the LORD s people were prophets that the LORD would put his Spirit on them
And Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp
Then a wind from the LORD sprang up and it brought quail from the sea and let them fall beside the camp about a day s journey on this side and a day s journey on the other side around the camp and about two cubits above the ground
And the people rose all that day and all night and all the next day and gathered the quail Those who gathered least gathered ten homers And they spread them out for themselves all around the camp
While the meat was yet between their teeth before it was consumed the anger of the LORD was kindled against the people and the LORD struck down the people with a very great plague
Therefore the name of that place was called Kibroth hattaavah because there they buried the people who had the craving
From Kibroth hattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth and they remained at Hazeroth
