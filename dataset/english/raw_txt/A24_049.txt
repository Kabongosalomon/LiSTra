Jeremiah 49
Concerning the Ammonites Thus says the LORD Has Israel no sons Has he no heir Why then has Milcom dispossessed Gad and his people settled in its cities
Therefore behold the days are coming declares the LORD when I will cause the battle cry to be heard against Rabbah of the Ammonites it shall become a desolate mound and its villages shall be burned with fire then Israel shall dispossess those who dispossessed him says the LORD
Wail O Heshbon for Ai is laid waste Cry out O daughters of Rabbah Put on sackcloth lament and run to and fro among the hedges For Milcom shall go into exile with his priests and his officials
Why do you boast of your valleys O faithless daughter who trusted in her treasures saying Who will come against me
Behold I will bring terror upon you declares the Lord GOD of hosts from all who are around you and you shall be driven out every man straight before him with none to gather the fugitives
But afterward I will restore the fortunes of the Ammonites declares the LORD
Concerning Edom Thus says the LORD of hosts Is wisdom no more in Teman Has counsel perished from the prudent Has their wisdom vanished
Flee turn back dwell in the depths O inhabitants of Dedan For I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him the time when I punish him
If grape gatherers came to you would they not leave gleanings If thieves came by night would they not destroy only enough for themselves
But I have stripped Esau bare I have uncovered his hiding places and he is not able to conceal himself His children are destroyed and his brothers and his neighbors and he is no more
Leave your fatherless children I will keep them alive and let your widows trust in me
For thus says the LORD If those who did not deserve to drink the cup must drink it will you go unpunished You shall not go unpunished but you must drink
For I have sworn by myself declares the LORD that Bozrah shall become a horror a taunt a waste and a curse and all her cities shall be perpetual wastes
I have heard a message from the LORD and an envoy has been sent among the nations Gather yourselves together and come against her and rise up for battle
For behold I will make you small among the nations despised among mankind
The horror you inspire has deceived you and the pride of your heart you who live in the clefts of the rock who hold the height of the hill Though you make your nest as high as the eagle s I will bring you down from there declares the LORD
Edom shall become a horror Everyone who passes by it will be horrified and will hiss because of all its disasters
As when Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring cities were overthrown says the LORD no man shall dwell there no man shall sojourn in her
Behold like a lion coming up from the jungle of the Jordan against a perennial pasture I will suddenly make him run away from her And I will appoint over her whomever I choose For who is like me Who will summon me What shepherd can stand before me
Therefore hear the plan that the LORD has made against Edom and the purposes that he has formed against the inhabitants of Teman Even the little ones of the flock shall be dragged away Surely their fold shall be appalled at their fate
At the sound of their fall the earth shall tremble the sound of their cry shall be heard at the Red Sea
Behold one shall mount up and fly swiftly like an eagle and spread his wings against Bozrah and the heart of the warriors of Edom shall be in that day like the heart of a woman in her birth pains
Concerning Damascus Hamath and Arpad are confounded for they have heard bad news they melt in fear they are troubled like the sea that cannot be quiet
Damascus has become feeble she turned to flee and panic seized her anguish and sorrows have taken hold of her as of a woman in labor
How is the famous city not forsaken the city of my joy
Therefore her young men shall fall in her squares and all her soldiers shall be destroyed in that day declares the LORD of hosts
And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus and it shall devour the strongholds of Ben hadad
Concerning Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon struck down Thus says the LORD Rise up advance against Kedar Destroy the people of the east
Their tents and their flocks shall be taken their curtains and all their goods their camels shall be led away from them and men shall cry to them Terror on every side
Flee wander far away dwell in the depths O inhabitants of Hazor declares the LORD For Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has made a plan against you and formed a purpose against you
Rise up advance against a nation at ease that dwells securely declares the LORD that has no gates or bars that dwells alone
Their camels shall become plunder their herds of livestock a spoil I will scatter to every wind those who cut the corners of their hair and I will bring their calamity from every side of them declares the LORD
Hazor shall become a haunt of jackals an everlasting waste no man shall dwell there no man shall sojourn in her
The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah
Thus says the LORD of hosts Behold I will break the bow of Elam the mainstay of their might
And I will bring upon Elam the four winds from the four quarters of heaven And I will scatter them to all those winds and there shall be no nation to which those driven out of Elam shall not come
I will terrify Elam before their enemies and before those who seek their life I will bring disaster upon them my fierce anger declares the LORD I will send the sword after them until I have consumed them
and I will set my throne in Elam and destroy their king and officials declares the LORD
But in the latter days I will restore the fortunes of Elam declares the LORD
