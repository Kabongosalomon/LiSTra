Romans 10
Brothers my heart s desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved
For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God but not according to knowledge
For being ignorant of the righteousness of God and seeking to establish their own they did not submit to God s righteousness
For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes
For Moses writes about the righteousness that is based on the law that the person who does the commandments shall live by them
But the righteousness based on faith says Do not say in your heart Who will ascend into heaven that is to bring Christ down
or Who will descend into the abyss that is to bring Christ up from the dead
But what does it say The word is near you in your mouth and in your heart that is the word of faith that we proclaim
because if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved
For with the heart one believes and is justified and with the mouth one confesses and is saved
For the Scripture says Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame
For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek for the same Lord is Lord of all bestowing his riches on all who call on him
For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved
How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard And how are they to hear without someone preaching
And how are they to preach unless they are sent As it is written How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news
But they have not all obeyed the gospel For Isaiah says Lord who has believed what he has heard from us
So faith comes from hearing and hearing through the word of Christ
But I ask have they not heard Indeed they have for Their voice has gone out to all the earth and their words to the ends of the world
But I ask did Israel not understand First Moses says I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation with a foolish nation I will make you angry
Then Isaiah is so bold as to say I have been found by those who did not seek me I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me
But of Israel he says All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people
