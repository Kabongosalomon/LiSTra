Jeremiah 12
Righteous are you O LORD when I complain to you yet I would plead my case before you Why does the way of the wicked prosper Why do all who are treacherous thrive
You plant them and they take root they grow and produce fruit you are near in their mouth and far from their heart
But you O LORD know me you see me and test my heart toward you Pull them out like sheep for the slaughter and set them apart for the day of slaughter
How long will the land mourn and the grass of every field wither For the evil of those who dwell in it the beasts and the birds are swept away because they said He will not see our latter end
If you have raced with men on foot and they have wearied you how will you compete with horses And if in a safe land you are so trusting what will you do in the thicket of the Jordan
For even your brothers and the house of your father even they have dealt treacherously with you they are in full cry after you do not believe them though they speak friendly words to you
I have forsaken my house I have abandoned my heritage I have given the beloved of my soul into the hands of her enemies
My heritage has become to me like a lion in the forest she has lifted up her voice against me therefore I hate her
Is my heritage to me like a hyena s lair Are the birds of prey against her all around Go assemble all the wild beasts bring them to devour
Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard they have trampled down my portion they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness
They have made it a desolation desolate it mourns to me The whole land is made desolate but no man lays it to heart
Upon all the bare heights in the desert destroyers have come for the sword of the LORD devours from one end of the land to the other no flesh has peace
They have sown wheat and have reaped thorns they have tired themselves out but profit nothing They shall be ashamed of their harvests because of the fierce anger of the LORD
Thus says the LORD concerning all my evil neighbors who touch the heritage that I have given my people Israel to inherit Behold I will pluck them up from their land and I will pluck up the house of Judah from among them
And after I have plucked them up I will again have compassion on them and I will bring them again each to his heritage and each to his land
And it shall come to pass if they will diligently learn the ways of my people to swear by my name As the LORD lives even as they taught my people to swear by Baal then they shall be built up in the midst of my people
But if any nation will not listen then I will utterly pluck it up and destroy it declares the LORD
