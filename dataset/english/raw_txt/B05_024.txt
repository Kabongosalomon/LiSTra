Acts 24
And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and a spokesman one Tertullus They laid before the governor their case against Paul
And when he had been summoned Tertullus began to accuse him saying Since through you we enjoy much peace and since by your foresight most excellent Felix reforms are being made for this nation
in every way and everywhere we accept this with all gratitude
But to detain you no further I beg you in your kindness to hear us briefly
For we have found this man a plague one who stirs up riots among all the Jews throughout the world and is a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes
He even tried to profane the temple but we seized him
By examining him yourself you will be able to find out from him about everything of which we accuse him
The Jews also joined in the charge affirming that all these things were so
And when the governor had nodded to him to speak Paul replied Knowing that for many years you have been a judge over this nation I cheerfully make my defense
You can verify that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem
and they did not find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd either in the temple or in the synagogues or in the city
Neither can they prove to you what they now bring up against me
But this I confess to you that according to the Way which they call a sect I worship the God of our fathers believing everything laid down by the Law and written in the Prophets
having a hope in God which these men themselves accept that there will be a resurrection of both the just and the unjust
So I always take pains to have a clear conscience toward both God and man
Now after several years I came to bring alms to my nation and to present offerings
While I was doing this they found me purified in the temple without any crowd or tumult But some Jews from Asia
they ought to be here before you and to make an accusation should they have anything against me
Or else let these men themselves say what wrongdoing they found when I stood before the council
other than this one thing that I cried out while standing among them It is with respect to the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you this day
But Felix having a rather accurate knowledge of the Way put them off saying When Lysias the tribune comes down I will decide your case
Then he gave orders to the centurion that he should be kept in custody but have some liberty and that none of his friends should be prevented from attending to his needs
After some days Felix came with his wife Drusilla who was Jewish and he sent for Paul and heard him speak about faith in Christ Jesus
And as he reasoned about righteousness and self control and the coming judgment Felix was alarmed and said Go away for the present When I get an opportunity I will summon you
At the same time he hoped that money would be given him by Paul So he sent for him often and conversed with him
When two years had elapsed Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus And desiring to do the Jews a favor Felix left Paul in prison
