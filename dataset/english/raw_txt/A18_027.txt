Job 27
And Job again took up his discourse and said
As God lives who has taken away my right and the Almighty who has made my soul bitter
as long as my breath is in me and the spirit of God is in my nostrils
my lips will not speak falsehood and my tongue will not utter deceit
Far be it from me to say that you are right till I die I will not put away my integrity from me
I hold fast my righteousness and will not let it go my heart does not reproach me for any of my days
Let my enemy be as the wicked and let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous
For what is the hope of the godless when God cuts him off when God takes away his life
Will God hear his cry when distress comes upon him
Will he take delight in the Almighty Will he call upon God at all times
I will teach you concerning the hand of God what is with the Almighty I will not conceal
Behold all of you have seen it yourselves why then have you become altogether vain
This is the portion of a wicked man with God and the heritage that oppressors receive from the Almighty
If his children are multiplied it is for the sword and his descendants have not enough bread
Those who survive him the pestilence buries and his widows do not weep
Though he heap up silver like dust and pile up clothing like clay
he may pile it up but the righteous will wear it and the innocent will divide the silver
He builds his house like a moth s like a booth that a watchman makes
He goes to bed rich but will do so no more he opens his eyes and his wealth is gone
Terrors overtake him like a flood in the night a whirlwind carries him off
The east wind lifts him up and he is gone it sweeps him out of his place
It hurls at him without pity he flees from its power in headlong flight
It claps its hands at him and hisses at him from its place
