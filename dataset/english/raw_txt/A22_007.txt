Song of Solomon 7
How beautiful are your feet in sandals O noble daughter Your rounded thighs are like jewels the work of a master hand
Your navel is a rounded bowl that never lacks mixed wine Your belly is a heap of wheat encircled with lilies
Your two breasts are like two fawns twins of a gazelle
Your neck is like an ivory tower Your eyes are pools in Heshbon by the gate of Bath rabbim Your nose is like a tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus
Your head crowns you like Carmel and your flowing locks are like purple a king is held captive in the tresses
How beautiful and pleasant you are O loved one with all your delights
Your stature is like a palm tree and your breasts are like its clusters
I say I will climb the palm tree and lay hold of its fruit Oh may your breasts be like clusters of the vine and the scent of your breath like apples
and your mouth like the best wine SHE It goes down smoothly for my beloved gliding over lips and teeth
I am my beloved s and his desire is for me
Come my beloved let us go out into the fields and lodge in the villages
let us go out early to the vineyards and see whether the vines have budded whether the grape blossoms have opened and the pomegranates are in bloom There I will give you my love
The mandrakes give forth fragrance and beside our doors are all choice fruits new as well as old which I have laid up for you O my beloved
