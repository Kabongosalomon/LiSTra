1 Chronicles 15
David built houses for himself in the city of David And he prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it
Then David said that no one but the Levites may carry the ark of God for the LORD had chosen them to carry the ark of the LORD and to minister to him forever
And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the LORD to its place which he had prepared for it
And David gathered together the sons of Aaron and the Levites
of the sons of Kohath Uriel the chief with of his brothers
of the sons of Merari Asaiah the chief with of his brothers
of the sons of Gershom Joel the chief with of his brothers
of the sons of Elizaphan Shemaiah the chief with of his brothers
of the sons of Hebron Eliel the chief with of his brothers
of the sons of Uzziel Amminadab the chief with of his brothers
Then David summoned the priests Zadok and Abiathar and the Levites Uriel Asaiah Joel Shemaiah Eliel and Amminadab
and said to them You are the heads of the fathers houses of the Levites Consecrate yourselves you and your brothers so that you may bring up the ark of the LORD the God of Israel to the place that I have prepared for it
Because you did not carry it the first time the LORD our God broke out against us because we did not seek him according to the rule
So the priests and the Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD the God of Israel
And the Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles as Moses had commanded according to the word of the LORD
David also commanded the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their brothers as the singers who should play loudly on musical instruments on harps and lyres and cymbals to raise sounds of joy
So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel and of his brothers Asaph the son of Berechiah and of the sons of Merari their brothers Ethan the son of Kushaiah
and with them their brothers of the second order Zechariah Jaaziel Shemiramoth Jehiel Unni Eliab Benaiah Maaseiah Mattithiah Eliphelehu and Mikneiah and the gatekeepers Obed edom and Jeiel
The singers Heman Asaph and Ethan were to sound bronze cymbals
Zechariah Aziel Shemiramoth Jehiel Unni Eliab Maaseiah and Benaiah were to play harps according to Alamoth
but Mattithiah Eliphelehu Mikneiah Obed edom Jeiel and Azaziah were to lead with lyres according to the Sheminith
Chenaniah leader of the Levites in music should direct the music for he understood it
Berechiah and Elkanah were to be gatekeepers for the ark
Shebaniah Joshaphat Nethanel Amasai Zechariah Benaiah and Eliezer the priests should blow the trumpets before the ark of God Obed edom and Jehiah were to be gatekeepers for the ark
So David and the elders of Israel and the commanders of thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the house of Obed edom with rejoicing
And because God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams
David was clothed with a robe of fine linen as also were all the Levites who were carrying the ark and the singers and Chenaniah the leader of the music of the singers And David wore a linen ephod
So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting to the sound of the horn trumpets and cymbals and made loud music on harps and lyres
And as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David Michal the daughter of Saul looked out of the window and saw King David dancing and rejoicing and she despised him in her heart
