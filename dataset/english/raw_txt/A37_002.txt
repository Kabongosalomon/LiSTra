Haggai 2
In the seventh month on the twenty first day of the month the word of the LORD came by the hand of Haggai the prophet
Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel governor of Judah and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak the high priest and to all the remnant of the people and say
Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory How do you see it now Is it not as nothing in your eyes
Yet now be strong O Zerubbabel declares the LORD Be strong O Joshua son of Jehozadak the high priest Be strong all you people of the land declares the LORD Work for I am with you declares the LORD of hosts
according to the covenant that I made with you when you came out of Egypt My Spirit remains in your midst Fear not
For thus says the LORD of hosts Yet once more in a little while I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land
And I will shake all nations so that the treasures of all nations shall come in and I will fill this house with glory says the LORD of hosts
The silver is mine and the gold is mine declares the LORD of hosts
The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former says the LORD of hosts And in this place I will give peace declares the LORD of hosts
On the twenty fourth day of the ninth month in the second year of Darius the word of the LORD came by Haggai the prophet
Thus says the LORD of hosts Ask the priests about the law
If someone carries holy meat in the fold of his garment and touches with his fold bread or stew or wine or oil or any kind of food does it become holy The priests answered and said No
Then Haggai said If someone who is unclean by contact with a dead body touches any of these does it become unclean The priests answered and said It does become unclean
Then Haggai answered and said So is it with this people and with this nation before me declares the LORD and so with every work of their hands And what they offer there is unclean
Now then consider from this day onward Before stone was placed upon stone in the temple of the LORD
how did you fare When one came to a heap of twenty measures there were but ten When one came to the wine vat to draw fifty measures there were but twenty
I struck you and all the products of your toil with blight and with mildew and with hail yet you did not turn to me declares the LORD
Consider from this day onward from the twenty fourth day of the ninth month Since the day that the foundation of the LORD s temple was laid consider
Is the seed yet in the barn Indeed the vine the fig tree the pomegranate and the olive tree have yielded nothing But from this day on I will bless you
The word of the LORD came a second time to Haggai on the twenty fourth day of the month
Speak to Zerubbabel governor of Judah saying I am about to shake the heavens and the earth
and to overthrow the throne of kingdoms I am about to destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations and overthrow the chariots and their riders And the horses and their riders shall go down every one by the sword of his brother
On that day declares the LORD of hosts I will take you O Zerubbabel my servant the son of Shealtiel declares the LORD and make you like a signet ring for I have chosen you declares the LORD of hosts
