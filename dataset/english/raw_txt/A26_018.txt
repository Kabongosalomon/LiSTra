Ezekiel 18
The word of the LORD came to me
What do you mean by repeating this proverb concerning the land of Israel The fathers have eaten sour grapes and the children s teeth are set on edge
As I live declares the Lord GOD this proverb shall no more be used by you in Israel
Behold all souls are mine the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is mine the soul who sins shall die
If a man is righteous and does what is just and right
if he does not eat upon the mountains or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel does not defile his neighbor s wife or approach a woman in her time of menstrual impurity
does not oppress anyone but restores to the debtor his pledge commits no robbery gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with a garment
does not lend at interest or take any profit withholds his hand from injustice executes true justice between man and man
walks in my statutes and keeps my rules by acting faithfully he is righteous he shall surely live declares the Lord GOD
If he fathers a son who is violent a shedder of blood who does any of these things
though he himself did none of these things who even eats upon the mountains defiles his neighbor s wife
oppresses the poor and needy commits robbery does not restore the pledge lifts up his eyes to the idols commits abomination
lends at interest and takes profit shall he then live He shall not live He has done all these abominations he shall surely die his blood shall be upon himself
Now suppose this man fathers a son who sees all the sins that his father has done he sees and does not do likewise
he does not eat upon the mountains or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel does not defile his neighbor s wife
does not oppress anyone exacts no pledge commits no robbery but gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with a garment
withholds his hand from iniquity takes no interest or profit obeys my rules and walks in my statutes he shall not die for his father s iniquity he shall surely live
As for his father because he practiced extortion robbed his brother and did what is not good among his people behold he shall die for his iniquity
Yet you say Why should not the son suffer for the iniquity of the father When the son has done what is just and right and has been careful to observe all my statutes he shall surely live
The soul who sins shall die The son shall not suffer for the iniquity of the father nor the father suffer for the iniquity of the son The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself
But if a wicked person turns away from all his sins that he has committed and keeps all my statutes and does what is just and right he shall surely live he shall not die
None of the transgressions that he has committed shall be remembered against him for the righteousness that he has done he shall live
Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked declares the Lord GOD and not rather that he should turn from his way and live
But when a righteous person turns away from his righteousness and does injustice and does the same abominations that the wicked person does shall he live None of the righteous deeds that he has done shall be remembered for the treachery of which he is guilty and the sin he has committed for them he shall die
Yet you say The way of the Lord is not just Hear now O house of Israel Is my way not just Is it not your ways that are not just
When a righteous person turns away from his righteousness and does injustice he shall die for it for the injustice that he has done he shall die
Again when a wicked person turns away from the wickedness he has committed and does what is just and right he shall save his life
Because he considered and turned away from all the transgressions that he had committed he shall surely live he shall not die
Yet the house of Israel says The way of the Lord is not just O house of Israel are my ways not just Is it not your ways that are not just
Therefore I will judge you O house of Israel every one according to his ways declares the Lord GOD Repent and turn from all your transgressions lest iniquity be your ruin
Cast away from you all the transgressions that you have committed and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit Why will you die O house of Israel
For I have no pleasure in the death of anyone declares the Lord GOD so turn and live
