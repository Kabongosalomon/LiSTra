Job 6
Then Job answered and said
Oh that my vexation were weighed and all my calamity laid in the balances
For then it would be heavier than the sand of the sea therefore my words have been rash
For the arrows of the Almighty are in me my spirit drinks their poison the terrors of God are arrayed against me
Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass or the ox low over his fodder
Can that which is tasteless be eaten without salt or is there any taste in the juice of the mallow
My appetite refuses to touch them they are as food that is loathsome to me
Oh that I might have my request and that God would fulfill my hope
that it would please God to crush me that he would let loose his hand and cut me off
This would be my comfort I would even exult in pain unsparing for I have not denied the words of the Holy One
What is my strength that I should wait And what is my end that I should be patient
Is my strength the strength of stones or is my flesh bronze
Have I any help in me when resource is driven from me
He who withholds kindness from a friend forsakes the fear of the Almighty
My brothers are treacherous as a torrent bed as torrential streams that pass away
which are dark with ice and where the snow hides itself
When they melt they disappear when it is hot they vanish from their place
The caravans turn aside from their course they go up into the waste and perish
The caravans of Tema look the travelers of Sheba hope
They are ashamed because they were confident they come there and are disappointed
For you have now become nothing you see my calamity and are afraid
Have I said Make me a gift Or From your wealth offer a bribe for me
Or Deliver me from the adversary s hand Or Redeem me from the hand of the ruthless
Teach me and I will be silent make me understand how I have gone astray
How forceful are upright words But what does reproof from you reprove
Do you think that you can reprove words when the speech of a despairing man is wind
You would even cast lots over the fatherless and bargain over your friend
But now be pleased to look at me for I will not lie to your face
Please turn let no injustice be done Turn now my vindication is at stake
Is there any injustice on my tongue Cannot my palate discern the cause of calamity
