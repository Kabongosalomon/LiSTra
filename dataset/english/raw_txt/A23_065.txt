Isaiah 65
I was ready to be sought by those who did not ask for me I was ready to be found by those who did not seek me I said Here am I here am I to a nation that was not called by my name
I spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people who walk in a way that is not good following their own devices
a people who provoke me to my face continually sacrificing in gardens and making offerings on bricks
who sit in tombs and spend the night in secret places who eat pig s flesh and broth of tainted meat is in their vessels
who say Keep to yourself do not come near me for I am too holy for you These are a smoke in my nostrils a fire that burns all the day
Behold it is written before me I will not keep silent but I will repay I will indeed repay into their bosom
both your iniquities and your fathers iniquities together says the LORD because they made offerings on the mountains and insulted me on the hills I will measure into their bosom payment for their former deeds
Thus says the LORD As the new wine is found in the cluster and they say Do not destroy it for there is a blessing in it so I will do for my servants sake and not destroy them all
I will bring forth offspring from Jacob and from Judah possessors of my mountains my chosen shall possess it and my servants shall dwell there
Sharon shall become a pasture for flocks and the Valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down for my people who have sought me
But you who forsake the LORD who forget my holy mountain who set a table for Fortune and fill cups of mixed wine for Destiny
I will destine you to the sword and all of you shall bow down to the slaughter because when I called you did not answer when I spoke you did not listen but you did what was evil in my eyes and chose what I did not delight in
Therefore thus says the Lord GOD Behold my servants shall eat but you shall be hungry behold my servants shall drink but you shall be thirsty behold my servants shall rejoice but you shall be put to shame
behold my servants shall sing for gladness of heart but you shall cry out for pain of heart and shall wail for breaking of spirit
You shall leave your name to my chosen for a curse and the Lord GOD will put you to death but his servants he will call by another name
So that he who blesses himself in the land shall bless himself by the God of truth and he who takes an oath in the land shall swear by the God of truth because the former troubles are forgotten and are hidden from my eyes
For behold I create new heavens and a new earth and the former things shall not be remembered or come into mind
But be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create for behold I create Jerusalem to be a joy and her people to be a gladness
I will rejoice in Jerusalem and be glad in my people no more shall be heard in it the sound of weeping and the cry of distress
No more shall there be in it an infant who lives but a few days or an old man who does not fill out his days for the young man shall die a hundred years old and the sinner a hundred years old shall be accursed
They shall build houses and inhabit them they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit
They shall not build and another inhabit they shall not plant and another eat for like the days of a tree shall the days of my people be and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands
They shall not labor in vain or bear children for calamity for they shall be the offspring of the blessed of the LORD and their descendants with them
Before they call I will answer while they are yet speaking I will hear
The wolf and the lamb shall graze together the lion shall eat straw like the ox and dust shall be the serpent s food They shall not hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain says the LORD
