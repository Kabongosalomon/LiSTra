Ezra 5
Now the prophets Haggai and Zechariah the son of Iddo prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel who was over them
Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak arose and began to rebuild the house of God that is in Jerusalem and the prophets of God were with them supporting them
At the same time Tattenai the governor of the province Beyond the River and Shethar bozenai and their associates came to them and spoke to them thus Who gave you a decree to build this house and to finish this structure
They also asked them this What are the names of the men who are building this building
But the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews and they did not stop them until the report should reach Darius and then an answer be returned by letter concerning it
This is a copy of the letter that Tattenai the governor of the province Beyond the River and Shethar bozenai and his associates the governors who were in the province Beyond the River sent to Darius the king
They sent him a report in which was written as follows To Darius the king all peace
Be it known to the king that we went to the province of Judah to the house of the great God It is being built with huge stones and timber is laid in the walls This work goes on diligently and prospers in their hands
Then we asked those elders and spoke to them thus Who gave you a decree to build this house and to finish this structure
We also asked them their names for your information that we might write down the names of their leaders
And this was their reply to us We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth and we are rebuilding the house that was built many years ago which a great king of Israel built and finished
But because our fathers had angered the God of heaven he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon the Chaldean who destroyed this house and carried away the people to Babylonia
However in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon Cyrus the king made a decree that this house of God should be rebuilt
And the gold and silver vessels of the house of God which Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple that was in Jerusalem and brought into the temple of Babylon these Cyrus the king took out of the temple of Babylon and they were delivered to one whose name was Sheshbazzar whom he had made governor
and he said to him Take these vessels go and put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem and let the house of God be rebuilt on its site
Then this Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the house of God that is in Jerusalem and from that time until now it has been in building and it is not yet finished
Therefore if it seems good to the king let search be made in the royal archives there in Babylon to see whether a decree was issued by Cyrus the king for the rebuilding of this house of God in Jerusalem And let the king send us his pleasure in this matter
