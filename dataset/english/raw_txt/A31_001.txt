Obadiah 1
The vision of Obadiah Thus says the Lord GOD concerning Edom We have heard a report from the LORD and a messenger has been sent among the nations Rise up Let us rise against her for battle
Behold I will make you small among the nations you shall be utterly despised
The pride of your heart has deceived you you who live in the clefts of the rock in your lofty dwelling who say in your heart Who will bring me down to the ground
Though you soar aloft like the eagle though your nest is set among the stars from there I will bring you down declares the LORD
If thieves came to you if plunderers came by night how you have been destroyed would they not steal only enough for themselves If grape gatherers came to you would they not leave gleanings
How Esau has been pillaged his treasures sought out
All your allies have driven you to your border those at peace with you have deceived you they have prevailed against you those who eat your bread have set a trap beneath you you have no understanding
Will I not on that day declares the LORD destroy the wise men out of Edom and understanding out of Mount Esau
And your mighty men shall be dismayed O Teman so that every man from Mount Esau will be cut off by slaughter
Because of the violence done to your brother Jacob shame shall cover you and you shall be cut off forever
On the day that you stood aloof on the day that strangers carried off his wealth and foreigners entered his gates and cast lots for Jerusalem you were like one of them
But do not gloat over the day of your brother in the day of his misfortune do not rejoice over the people of Judah in the day of their ruin do not boast in the day of distress
Do not enter the gate of my people in the day of their calamity do not gloat over his disaster in the day of his calamity do not loot his wealth in the day of his calamity
Do not stand at the crossroads to cut off his fugitives do not hand over his survivors in the day of distress
For the day of the LORD is near upon all the nations As you have done it shall be done to you your deeds shall return on your own head
For as you have drunk on my holy mountain so all the nations shall drink continually they shall drink and swallow and shall be as though they had never been
But in Mount Zion there shall be those who escape and it shall be holy and the house of Jacob shall possess their own possessions
The house of Jacob shall be a fire and the house of Joseph a flame and the house of Esau stubble they shall burn them and consume them and there shall be no survivor for the house of Esau for the LORD has spoken
Those of the Negeb shall possess Mount Esau and those of the Shephelah shall possess the land of the Philistines they shall possess the land of Ephraim and the land of Samaria and Benjamin shall possess Gilead
The exiles of this host of the people of Israel shall possess the land of the Canaanites as far as Zarephath and the exiles of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad shall possess the cities of the Negeb
Saviors shall go up to Mount Zion to rule Mount Esau and the kingdom shall be the LORD s
