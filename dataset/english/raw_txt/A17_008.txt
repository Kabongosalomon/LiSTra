Esther 8
On that day King Ahasuerus gave to Queen Esther the house of Haman the enemy of the Jews And Mordecai came before the king for Esther had told what he was to her
And the king took off his signet ring which he had taken from Haman and gave it to Mordecai And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman
Then Esther spoke again to the king She fell at his feet and wept and pleaded with him to avert the evil plan of Haman the Agagite and the plot that he had devised against the Jews
When the king held out the golden scepter to Esther
Esther rose and stood before the king And she said If it please the king and if I have found favor in his sight and if the thing seems right before the king and I am pleasing in his eyes let an order be written to revoke the letters devised by Haman the Agagite the son of Hammedatha which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the provinces of the king
For how can I bear to see the calamity that is coming to my people Or how can I bear to see the destruction of my kindred
Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew Behold I have given Esther the house of Haman and they have hanged him on the gallows because he intended to lay hands on the Jews
But you may write as you please with regard to the Jews in the name of the king and seal it with the king s ring for an edict written in the name of the king and sealed with the king s ring cannot be revoked
The king s scribes were summoned at that time in the third month which is the month of Sivan on the twenty third day And an edict was written according to all that Mordecai commanded concerning the Jews to the satraps and the governors and the officials of the provinces from India to Ethiopia provinces to each province in its own script and to each people in its own language and also to the Jews in their script and their language
And he wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed it with the king s signet ring Then he sent the letters by mounted couriers riding on swift horses that were used in the king s service bred from the royal stud
saying that the king allowed the Jews who were in every city to gather and defend their lives to destroy to kill and to annihilate any armed force of any people or province that might attack them children and women included and to plunder their goods
on one day throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month which is the month of Adar
A copy of what was written was to be issued as a decree in every province being publicly displayed to all peoples and the Jews were to be ready on that day to take vengeance on their enemies
So the couriers mounted on their swift horses that were used in the king s service rode out hurriedly urged by the king s command And the decree was issued in Susa the citadel
Then Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal robes of blue and white with a great golden crown and a robe of fine linen and purple and the city of Susa shouted and rejoiced
The Jews had light and gladness and joy and honor
And in every province and in every city wherever the king s command and his edict reached there was gladness and joy among the Jews a feast and a holiday And many from the peoples of the country declared themselves Jews for fear of the Jews had fallen on them
