1 Samuel 15
And Samuel said to Saul The LORD sent me to anoint you king over his people Israel now therefore listen to the words of the LORD
Thus says the LORD of hosts I have noted what Amalek did to Israel in opposing them on the way when they came up out of Egypt
Now go and strike Amalek and devote to destruction all that they have Do not spare them but kill both man and woman child and infant ox and sheep camel and donkey
So Saul summoned the people and numbered them in Telaim two hundred thousand men on foot and ten thousand men of Judah
And Saul came to the city of Amalek and lay in wait in the valley
Then Saul said to the Kenites Go depart go down from among the Amalekites lest I destroy you with them For you showed kindness to all the people of Israel when they came up out of Egypt So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites
And Saul defeated the Amalekites from Havilah as far as Shur which is east of Egypt
And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive and devoted to destruction all the people with the edge of the sword
But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep and of the oxen and of the fattened calves and the lambs and all that was good and would not utterly destroy them All that was despised and worthless they devoted to destruction
The word of the LORD came to Samuel
I regret that I have made Saul king for he has turned back from following me and has not performed my commandments And Samuel was angry and he cried to the LORD all night
And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning And it was told Samuel Saul came to Carmel and behold he set up a monument for himself and turned and passed on and went down to Gilgal
And Samuel came to Saul and Saul said to him Blessed be you to the LORD I have performed the commandment of the LORD
And Samuel said What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears and the lowing of the oxen that I hear
Saul said They have brought them from the Amalekites for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice to the LORD your God and the rest we have devoted to destruction
Then Samuel said to Saul Stop I will tell you what the LORD said to me this night And he said to him Speak
And Samuel said Though you are little in your own eyes are you not the head of the tribes of Israel The LORD anointed you king over Israel
And the LORD sent you on a mission and said Go devote to destruction the sinners the Amalekites and fight against them until they are consumed
Why then did you not obey the voice of the LORD Why did you pounce on the spoil and do what was evil in the sight of the LORD
And Saul said to Samuel I have obeyed the voice of the LORD I have gone on the mission on which the LORD sent me I have brought Agag the king of Amalek and I have devoted the Amalekites to destruction
But the people took of the spoil sheep and oxen the best of the things devoted to destruction to sacrifice to the LORD your God in Gilgal
And Samuel said Has the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the LORD Behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to listen than the fat of rams
For rebellion is as the sin of divination and presumption is as iniquity and idolatry Because you have rejected the word of the LORD he has also rejected you from being king
Saul said to Samuel I have sinned for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD and your words because I feared the people and obeyed their voice
Now therefore please pardon my sin and return with me that I may worship the LORD
And Samuel said to Saul I will not return with you For you have rejected the word of the LORD and the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel
As Samuel turned to go away Saul seized the skirt of his robe and it tore
And Samuel said to him The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day and has given it to a neighbor of yours who is better than you
And also the Glory of Israel will not lie or have regret for he is not a man that he should have regret
Then he said I have sinned yet honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel and return with me that I may bow before the LORD your God
So Samuel turned back after Saul and Saul bowed before the LORD
Then Samuel said Bring here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites And Agag came to him cheerfully Agag said Surely the bitterness of death is past
And Samuel said As your sword has made women childless so shall your mother be childless among women And Samuel hacked Agag to pieces before the LORD in Gilgal
Then Samuel went to Ramah and Saul went up to his house in Gibeah of Saul
And Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death but Samuel grieved over Saul And the LORD regretted that he had made Saul king over Israel
