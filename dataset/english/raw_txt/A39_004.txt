Malachi 4
For behold the day is coming burning like an oven when all the arrogant and all evildoers will be stubble The day that is coming shall set them ablaze says the LORD of hosts so that it will leave them neither root nor branch
But for you who fear my name the sun of righteousness shall rise with healing in its wings You shall go out leaping like calves from the stall
And you shall tread down the wicked for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day when I act says the LORD of hosts
Remember the law of my servant Moses the statutes and rules that I commanded him at Horeb for all Israel
Behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and awesome day of the LORD comes
And he will turn the hearts of fathers to their children and the hearts of children to their fathers lest I come and strike the land with a decree of utter destruction
