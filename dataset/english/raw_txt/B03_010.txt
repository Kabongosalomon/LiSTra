Luke 10
After this the Lord appointed seventy two others and sent them on ahead of him two by two into every town and place where he himself was about to go
And he said to them The harvest is plentiful but the laborers are few Therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest
Go your way behold I am sending you out as lambs in the midst of wolves
Carry no moneybag no knapsack no sandals and greet no one on the road
Whatever house you enter first say Peace be to this house
And if a son of peace is there your peace will rest upon him But if not it will return to you
And remain in the same house eating and drinking what they provide for the laborer deserves his wages Do not go from house to house
Whenever you enter a town and they receive you eat what is set before you
Heal the sick in it and say to them The kingdom of God has come near to you
But whenever you enter a town and they do not receive you go into its streets and say
Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet we wipe off against you Nevertheless know this that the kingdom of God has come near
I tell you it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town
Woe to you Chorazin Woe to you Bethsaida For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon they would have repented long ago sitting in sackcloth and ashes
But it will be more bearable in the judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you
And you Capernaum will you be exalted to heaven You shall be brought down to Hades
The one who hears you hears me and the one who rejects you rejects me and the one who rejects me rejects him who sent me
The seventy two returned with joy saying Lord even the demons are subject to us in your name
And he said to them I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven
Behold I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall hurt you
Nevertheless do not rejoice in this that the spirits are subject to you but rejoice that your names are written in heaven
In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said I thank you Father Lord of heaven and earth that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children yes Father for such was your gracious will
All things have been handed over to me by my Father and no one knows who the Son is except the Father or who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him
Then turning to the disciples he said privately Blessed are the eyes that see what you see
For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see and did not see it and to hear what you hear and did not hear it
And behold a lawyer stood up to put him to the test saying Teacher what shall I do to inherit eternal life
He said to him What is written in the Law How do you read it
And he answered You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind and your neighbor as yourself
And he said to him You have answered correctly do this and you will live
But he desiring to justify himself said to Jesus And who is my neighbor
Jesus replied A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho and he fell among robbers who stripped him and beat him and departed leaving him half dead
Now by chance a priest was going down that road and when he saw him he passed by on the other side
So likewise a Levite when he came to the place and saw him passed by on the other side
But a Samaritan as he journeyed came to where he was and when he saw him he had compassion
He went to him and bound up his wounds pouring on oil and wine Then he set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him
And the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper saying Take care of him and whatever more you spend I will repay you when I come back
Which of these three do you think proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers
He said The one who showed him mercy And Jesus said to him You go and do likewise
Now as they went on their way Jesus entered a village And a woman named Martha welcomed him into her house
And she had a sister called Mary who sat at the Lord s feet and listened to his teaching
But Martha was distracted with much serving And she went up to him and said Lord do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone Tell her then to help me
But the Lord answered her Martha Martha you are anxious and troubled about many things
but one thing is necessary Mary has chosen the good portion which will not be taken away from her
