Ezekiel 20
In the seventh year in the fifth month on the tenth day of the month certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the LORD and sat before me
And the word of the LORD came to me
Son of man speak to the elders of Israel and say to them Thus says the Lord GOD Is it to inquire of me that you come As I live declares the Lord GOD I will not be inquired of by you
Will you judge them son of man will you judge them Let them know the abominations of their fathers
and say to them Thus says the Lord GOD On the day when I chose Israel I swore to the offspring of the house of Jacob making myself known to them in the land of Egypt I swore to them saying I am the LORD your God
On that day I swore to them that I would bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them a land flowing with milk and honey the most glorious of all lands
And I said to them Cast away the detestable things your eyes feast on every one of you and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt I am the LORD your God
But they rebelled against me and were not willing to listen to me None of them cast away the detestable things their eyes feasted on nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them and spend my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt
But I acted for the sake of my name that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations among whom they lived in whose sight I made myself known to them in bringing them out of the land of Egypt
So I led them out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness
I gave them my statutes and made known to them my rules by which if a person does them he shall live
Moreover I gave them my Sabbaths as a sign between me and them that they might know that I am the LORD who sanctifies them
But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness They did not walk in my statutes but rejected my rules by which if a person does them he shall live and my Sabbaths they greatly profaned Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them in the wilderness to make a full end of them
But I acted for the sake of my name that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out
Moreover I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land that I had given them a land flowing with milk and honey the most glorious of all lands
because they rejected my rules and did not walk in my statutes and profaned my Sabbaths for their heart went after their idols
Nevertheless my eye spared them and I did not destroy them or make a full end of them in the wilderness
And I said to their children in the wilderness Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers nor keep their rules nor defile yourselves with their idols
I am the LORD your God walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules
and keep my Sabbaths holy that they may be a sign between me and you that you may know that I am the LORD your God
But the children rebelled against me They did not walk in my statutes and were not careful to obey my rules by which if a person does them he shall live they profaned my Sabbaths Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them and spend my anger against them in the wilderness
But I withheld my hand and acted for the sake of my name that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out
Moreover I swore to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them through the countries
because they had not obeyed my rules but had rejected my statutes and profaned my Sabbaths and their eyes were set on their fathers idols
Moreover I gave them statutes that were not good and rules by which they could not have life
and I defiled them through their very gifts in their offering up all their firstborn that I might devastate them I did it that they might know that I am the LORD
Therefore son of man speak to the house of Israel and say to them Thus says the Lord GOD In this also your fathers blasphemed me by dealing treacherously with me
For when I had brought them into the land that I swore to give them then wherever they saw any high hill or any leafy tree there they offered their sacrifices and there they presented the provocation of their offering there they sent up their pleasing aromas and there they poured out their drink offerings
I said to them What is the high place to which you go So its name is called Bamah to this day
Therefore say to the house of Israel Thus says the Lord GOD Will you defile yourselves after the manner of your fathers and go whoring after their detestable things
When you present your gifts and offer up your children in fire you defile yourselves with all your idols to this day And shall I be inquired of by you O house of Israel As I live declares the Lord GOD I will not be inquired of by you
What is in your mind shall never happen the thought Let us be like the nations like the tribes of the countries and worship wood and stone
As I live declares the Lord GOD surely with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with wrath poured out I will be king over you
I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries where you are scattered with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with wrath poured out
And I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples and there I will enter into judgment with you face to face
As I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt so I will enter into judgment with you declares the Lord GOD
I will make you pass under the rod and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant
I will purge out the rebels from among you and those who transgress against me I will bring them out of the land where they sojourn but they shall not enter the land of Israel Then you will know that I am the LORD
As for you O house of Israel thus says the Lord GOD Go serve every one of you his idols now and hereafter if you will not listen to me but my holy name you shall no more profane with your gifts and your idols
For on my holy mountain the mountain height of Israel declares the Lord GOD there all the house of Israel all of them shall serve me in the land There I will accept them and there I will require your contributions and the choicest of your gifts with all your sacred offerings
As a pleasing aroma I will accept you when I bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries where you have been scattered And I will manifest my holiness among you in the sight of the nations
And you shall know that I am the LORD when I bring you into the land of Israel the country that I swore to give to your fathers
And there you shall remember your ways and all your deeds with which you have defiled yourselves and you shall loathe yourselves for all the evils that you have committed
And you shall know that I am the LORD when I deal with you for my name s sake not according to your evil ways nor according to your corrupt deeds O house of Israel declares the Lord GOD
And the word of the LORD came to me
Son of man set your face toward the southland preach against the south and prophesy against the forest land in the Negeb
Say to the forest of the Negeb Hear the word of the LORD Thus says the Lord GOD Behold I will kindle a fire in you and it shall devour every green tree in you and every dry tree The blazing flame shall not be quenched and all faces from south to north shall be scorched by it
All flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it it shall not be quenched
Then I said Ah Lord GOD They are saying of me Is he not a maker of parables
