Job 7
Has not man a hard service on earth and are not his days like the days of a hired hand
Like a slave who longs for the shadow and like a hired hand who looks for his wages
so I am allotted months of emptiness and nights of misery are apportioned to me
When I lie down I say When shall I arise But the night is long and I am full of tossing till the dawn
My flesh is clothed with worms and dirt my skin hardens then breaks out afresh
My days are swifter than a weaver s shuttle and come to their end without hope
Remember that my life is a breath my eye will never again see good
The eye of him who sees me will behold me no more while your eyes are on me I shall be gone
As the cloud fades and vanishes so he who goes down to Sheol does not come up
he returns no more to his house nor does his place know him anymore
Therefore I will not restrain my mouth I will speak in the anguish of my spirit I will complain in the bitterness of my soul
Am I the sea or a sea monster that you set a guard over me
When I say My bed will comfort me my couch will ease my complaint
then you scare me with dreams and terrify me with visions
so that I would choose strangling and death rather than my bones
I loathe my life I would not live forever Leave me alone for my days are a breath
What is man that you make so much of him and that you set your heart on him
visit him every morning and test him every moment
How long will you not look away from me nor leave me alone till I swallow my spit
If I sin what do I do to you you watcher of mankind Why have you made me your mark Why have I become a burden to you
Why do you not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity For now I shall lie in the earth you will seek me but I shall not be
