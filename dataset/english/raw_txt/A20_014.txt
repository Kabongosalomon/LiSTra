Proverbs 14
The wisest of women builds her house but folly with her own hands tears it down
Whoever walks in uprightness fears the LORD but he who is devious in his ways despises him
By the mouth of a fool comes a rod for his back but the lips of the wise will preserve them
Where there are no oxen the manger is clean but abundant crops come by the strength of the ox
A faithful witness does not lie but a false witness breathes out lies
A scoffer seeks wisdom in vain but knowledge is easy for a man of understanding
Leave the presence of a fool for there you do not meet words of knowledge
The wisdom of the prudent is to discern his way but the folly of fools is deceiving
Fools mock at the guilt offering but the upright enjoy acceptance
The heart knows its own bitterness and no stranger shares its joy
The house of the wicked will be destroyed but the tent of the upright will flourish
There is a way that seems right to a man but its end is the way to death
Even in laughter the heart may ache and the end of joy may be grief
The backslider in heart will be filled with the fruit of his ways and a good man will be filled with the fruit of his ways
The simple believes everything but the prudent gives thought to his steps
One who is wise is cautious and turns away from evil but a fool is reckless and careless
A man of quick temper acts foolishly and a man of evil devices is hated
The simple inherit folly but the prudent are crowned with knowledge
The evil bow down before the good the wicked at the gates of the righteous
The poor is disliked even by his neighbor but the rich has many friends
Whoever despises his neighbor is a sinner but blessed is he who is generous to the poor
Do they not go astray who devise evil Those who devise good meet steadfast love and faithfulness
In all toil there is profit but mere talk tends only to poverty
The crown of the wise is their wealth but the folly of fools brings folly
A truthful witness saves lives but one who breathes out lies is deceitful
In the fear of the LORD one has strong confidence and his children will have a refuge
The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life that one may turn away from the snares of death
In a multitude of people is the glory of a king but without people a prince is ruined
Whoever is slow to anger has great understanding but he who has a hasty temper exalts folly
A tranquil heart gives life to the flesh but envy makes the bones rot
Whoever oppresses a poor man insults his Maker but he who is generous to the needy honors him
The wicked is overthrown through his evildoing but the righteous finds refuge in his death
Wisdom rests in the heart of a man of understanding but it makes itself known even in the midst of fools
Righteousness exalts a nation but sin is a reproach to any people
A servant who deals wisely has the king s favor but his wrath falls on one who acts shamefully
