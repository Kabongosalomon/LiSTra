Ruth 3
Then Naomi her mother in law said to her My daughter should I not seek rest for you that it may be well with you
Is not Boaz our relative with whose young women you were See he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor
Wash therefore and anoint yourself and put on your cloak and go down to the threshing floor but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking
But when he lies down observe the place where he lies Then go and uncover his feet and lie down and he will tell you what to do
And she replied All that you say I will do
So she went down to the threshing floor and did just as her mother in law had commanded her
And when Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain Then she came softly and uncovered his feet and lay down
At midnight the man was startled and turned over and behold a woman lay at his feet
He said Who are you And she answered I am Ruth your servant Spread your wings over your servant for you are a redeemer
And he said May you be blessed by the LORD my daughter You have made this last kindness greater than the first in that you have not gone after young men whether poor or rich
And now my daughter do not fear I will do for you all that you ask for all my fellow townsmen know that you are a worthy woman
And now it is true that I am a redeemer Yet there is a redeemer nearer than I
Remain tonight and in the morning if he will redeem you good let him do it But if he is not willing to redeem you then as the LORD lives I will redeem you Lie down until the morning
So she lay at his feet until the morning but arose before one could recognize another And he said Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor
And he said Bring the garment you are wearing and hold it out So she held it and he measured out six measures of barley and put it on her Then she went into the city
And when she came to her mother in law she said How did you fare my daughter Then she told her all that the man had done for her
saying These six measures of barley he gave to me for he said to me You must not go back empty handed to your mother in law
She replied Wait my daughter until you learn how the matter turns out for the man will not rest but will settle the matter today
