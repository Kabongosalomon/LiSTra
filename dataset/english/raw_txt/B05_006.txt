Acts 6
Now in these days when the disciples were increasing in number a complaint by the Hellenists arose against the Hebrews because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution
And the twelve summoned the full number of the disciples and said It is not right that we should give up preaching the word of God to serve tables
Therefore brothers pick out from among you seven men of good repute full of the Spirit and of wisdom whom we will appoint to this duty
But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word
And what they said pleased the whole gathering and they chose Stephen a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicolaus a proselyte of Antioch
These they set before the apostles and they prayed and laid their hands on them
And the word of God continued to increase and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem and a great many of the priests became obedient to the faith
And Stephen full of grace and power was doing great wonders and signs among the people
Then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen as it was called and of the Cyrenians and of the Alexandrians and of those from Cilicia and Asia rose up and disputed with Stephen
But they could not withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he was speaking
Then they secretly instigated men who said We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God
And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes and they came upon him and seized him and brought him before the council
and they set up false witnesses who said This man never ceases to speak words against this holy place and the law
for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and will change the customs that Moses delivered to us
And gazing at him all who sat in the council saw that his face was like the face of an angel
