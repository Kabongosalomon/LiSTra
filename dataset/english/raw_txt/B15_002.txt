1 Timothy 2
First of all then I urge that supplications prayers intercessions and thanksgivings be made for all people
for kings and all who are in high positions that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life godly and dignified in every way
This is good and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior
who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth
For there is one God and there is one mediator between God and men the man Christ Jesus
who gave himself as a ransom for all which is the testimony given at the proper time
For this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle I am telling the truth I am not lying a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth
I desire then that in every place the men should pray lifting holy hands without anger or quarreling
likewise also that women should adorn themselves in respectable apparel with modesty and self control not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly attire
but with what is proper for women who profess godliness with good works
Let a woman learn quietly with all submissiveness
I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man rather she is to remain quiet
For Adam was formed first then Eve
and Adam was not deceived but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor
Yet she will be saved through childbearing if they continue in faith and love and holiness with self control
