1 Samuel 20
Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah and came and said before Jonathan What have I done What is my guilt And what is my sin before your father that he seeks my life
And he said to him Far from it You shall not die Behold my father does nothing either great or small without disclosing it to me And why should my father hide this from me It is not so
But David vowed again saying Your father knows well that I have found favor in your eyes and he thinks Do not let Jonathan know this lest he be grieved But truly as the LORD lives and as your soul lives there is but a step between me and death
Then Jonathan said to David Whatever you say I will do for you
David said to Jonathan Behold tomorrow is the new moon and I should not fail to sit at table with the king But let me go that I may hide myself in the field till the third day at evening
If your father misses me at all then say David earnestly asked leave of me to run to Bethlehem his city for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the clan
If he says Good it will be well with your servant but if he is angry then know that harm is determined by him
Therefore deal kindly with your servant for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the LORD with you But if there is guilt in me kill me yourself for why should you bring me to your father
And Jonathan said Far be it from you If I knew that it was determined by my father that harm should come to you would I not tell you
Then David said to Jonathan Who will tell me if your father answers you roughly
And Jonathan said to David Come let us go out into the field So they both went out into the field
And Jonathan said to David The LORD the God of Israel be witness When I have sounded out my father about this time tomorrow or the third day behold if he is well disposed toward David shall I not then send and disclose it to you
But should it please my father to do you harm the LORD do so to Jonathan and more also if I do not disclose it to you and send you away that you may go in safety May the LORD be with you as he has been with my father
If I am still alive show me the steadfast love of the LORD that I may not die
and do not cut off your steadfast love from my house forever when the LORD cuts off every one of the enemies of David from the face of the earth
And Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David saying May the LORD take vengeance on David s enemies
And Jonathan made David swear again by his love for him for he loved him as he loved his own soul
Then Jonathan said to him Tomorrow is the new moon and you will be missed because your seat will be empty
On the third day go down quickly to the place where you hid yourself when the matter was in hand and remain beside the stone heap
And I will shoot three arrows to the side of it as though I shot at a mark
And behold I will send the young man saying Go find the arrows If I say to the young man Look the arrows are on this side of you take them then you are to come for as the LORD lives it is safe for you and there is no danger
But if I say to the youth Look the arrows are beyond you then go for the LORD has sent you away
And as for the matter of which you and I have spoken behold the LORD is between you and me forever
So David hid himself in the field And when the new moon came the king sat down to eat food
The king sat on his seat as at other times on the seat by the wall Jonathan sat opposite and Abner sat by Saul s side but David s place was empty
Yet Saul did not say anything that day for he thought Something has happened to him He is not clean surely he is not clean
But on the second day the day after the new moon David s place was empty And Saul said to Jonathan his son Why has not the son of Jesse come to the meal either yesterday or today
Jonathan answered Saul David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem
He said Let me go for our clan holds a sacrifice in the city and my brother has commanded me to be there So now if I have found favor in your eyes let me get away and see my brothers For this reason he has not come to the king s table
Then Saul s anger was kindled against Jonathan and he said to him You son of a perverse rebellious woman do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of your mother s nakedness
For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth neither you nor your kingdom shall be established Therefore send and bring him to me for he shall surely die
Then Jonathan answered Saul his father Why should he be put to death What has he done
But Saul hurled his spear at him to strike him So Jonathan knew that his father was determined to put David to death
And Jonathan rose from the table in fierce anger and ate no food the second day of the month for he was grieved for David because his father had disgraced him
In the morning Jonathan went out into the field to the appointment with David and with him a little boy
And he said to his boy Run and find the arrows that I shoot As the boy ran he shot an arrow beyond him
And when the boy came to the place of the arrow that Jonathan had shot Jonathan called after the boy and said Is not the arrow beyond you
And Jonathan called after the boy Hurry Be quick Do not stay So Jonathan s boy gathered up the arrows and came to his master
But the boy knew nothing Only Jonathan and David knew the matter
And Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy and said to him Go and carry them to the city
And as soon as the boy had gone David rose from beside the stone heap and fell on his face to the ground and bowed three times And they kissed one another and wept with one another David weeping the most
Then Jonathan said to David Go in peace because we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD saying The LORD shall be between me and you and between my offspring and your offspring forever And he rose and departed and Jonathan went into the city
