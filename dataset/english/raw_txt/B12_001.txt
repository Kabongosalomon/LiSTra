Colossians 1
Paul an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God and Timothy our brother
To the saints and faithful brothers in Christ at Colossae Grace to you and peace from God our Father
We always thank God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ when we pray for you
since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love that you have for all the saints
because of the hope laid up for you in heaven Of this you have heard before in the word of the truth the gospel
which has come to you as indeed in the whole world it is bearing fruit and growing as it also does among you since the day you heard it and understood the grace of God in truth
just as you learned it from Epaphras our beloved fellow servant He is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf
and has made known to us your love in the Spirit
And so from the day we heard we have not ceased to pray for you asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding
so as to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord fully pleasing to him bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God
May you be strengthened with all power according to his glorious might for all endurance and patience with joy
giving thanks to the Father who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in light
He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son
in whom we have redemption the forgiveness of sins
He is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of all creation
For by him all things were created in heaven and on earth visible and invisible whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities all things were created through him and for him
And he is before all things and in him all things hold together
And he is the head of the body the church He is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in everything he might be preeminent
For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell
and through him to reconcile to himself all things whether on earth or in heaven making peace by the blood of his cross
And you who once were alienated and hostile in mind doing evil deeds
he has now reconciled in his body of flesh by his death in order to present you holy and blameless and above reproach before him
if indeed you continue in the faith stable and steadfast not shifting from the hope of the gospel that you heard which has been proclaimed in all creation under heaven and of which I Paul became a minister
Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake and in my flesh I am filling up what is lacking in Christ s afflictions for the sake of his body that is the church
of which I became a minister according to the stewardship from God that was given to me for you to make the word of God fully known
the mystery hidden for ages and generations but now revealed to his saints
To them God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery which is Christ in you the hope of glory
Him we proclaim warning everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom that we may present everyone mature in Christ
For this I toil struggling with all his energy that he powerfully works within me
