Luke 19
He entered Jericho and was passing through
And there was a man named Zacchaeus He was a chief tax collector and was rich
And he was seeking to see who Jesus was but on account of the crowd he could not because he was small of stature
So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him for he was about to pass that way
And when Jesus came to the place he looked up and said to him Zacchaeus hurry and come down for I must stay at your house today
So he hurried and came down and received him joyfully
And when they saw it they all grumbled He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner
And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord Behold Lord the half of my goods I give to the poor And if I have defrauded anyone of anything I restore it fourfold
And Jesus said to him Today salvation has come to this house since he also is a son of Abraham
For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost
As they heard these things he proceeded to tell a parable because he was near to Jerusalem and because they supposed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately
He said therefore A nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return
Calling ten of his servants he gave them ten minas and said to them Engage in business until I come
But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him saying We do not want this man to reign over us
When he returned having received the kingdom he ordered these servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him that he might know what they had gained by doing business
The first came before him saying Lord your mina has made ten minas more
And he said to him Well done good servant Because you have been faithful in a very little you shall have authority over ten cities
And the second came saying Lord your mina has made five minas
And he said to him And you are to be over five cities
Then another came saying Lord here is your mina which I kept laid away in a handkerchief
for I was afraid of you because you are a severe man You take what you did not deposit and reap what you did not sow
He said to him I will condemn you with your own words you wicked servant You knew that I was a severe man taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow
Why then did you not put my money in the bank and at my coming I might have collected it with interest
And he said to those who stood by Take the mina from him and give it to the one who has the ten minas
And they said to him Lord he has ten minas
I tell you that to everyone who has more will be given but from the one who has not even what he has will be taken away
But as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to reign over them bring them here and slaughter them before me
And when he had said these things he went on ahead going up to Jerusalem
When he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany at the mount that is called Olivet he sent two of the disciples
saying Go into the village in front of you where on entering you will find a colt tied on which no one has ever yet sat Untie it and bring it here
If anyone asks you Why are you untying it you shall say this The Lord has need of it
So those who were sent went away and found it just as he had told them
And as they were untying the colt its owners said to them Why are you untying the colt
And they said The Lord has need of it
And they brought it to Jesus and throwing their cloaks on the colt they set Jesus on it
And as he rode along they spread their cloaks on the road
As he was drawing near already on the way down the Mount of Olives the whole multitude of his disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen
saying Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord Peace in heaven and glory in the highest
And some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him Teacher rebuke your disciples
He answered I tell you if these were silent the very stones would cry out
And when he drew near and saw the city he wept over it
saying Would that you even you had known on this day the things that make for peace But now they are hidden from your eyes
For the days will come upon you when your enemies will set up a barricade around you and surround you and hem you in on every side
and tear you down to the ground you and your children within you And they will not leave one stone upon another in you because you did not know the time of your visitation
And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold
saying to them It is written My house shall be a house of prayer but you have made it a den of robbers
And he was teaching daily in the temple The chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the people were seeking to destroy him
but they did not find anything they could do for all the people were hanging on his words
