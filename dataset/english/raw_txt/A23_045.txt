Isaiah 45
Thus says the LORD to his anointed to Cyrus whose right hand I have grasped to subdue nations before him and to loose the belts of kings to open doors before him that gates may not be closed
I will go before you and level the exalted places I will break in pieces the doors of bronze and cut through the bars of iron
I will give you the treasures of darkness and the hoards in secret places that you may know that it is I the LORD the God of Israel who call you by your name
For the sake of my servant Jacob and Israel my chosen I call you by your name I name you though you do not know me
I am the LORD and there is no other besides me there is no God I equip you though you do not know me
that people may know from the rising of the sun and from the west that there is none besides me I am the LORD and there is no other
I form light and create darkness I make well being and create calamity I am the LORD who does all these things
Shower O heavens from above and let the clouds rain down righteousness let the earth open that salvation and righteousness may bear fruit let the earth cause them both to sprout I the LORD have created it
Woe to him who strives with him who formed him a pot among earthen pots Does the clay say to him who forms it What are you making or Your work has no handles
Woe to him who says to a father What are you begetting or to a woman With what are you in labor
Thus says the LORD the Holy One of Israel and the one who formed him Ask me of things to come will you command me concerning my children and the work of my hands
I made the earth and created man on it it was my hands that stretched out the heavens and I commanded all their host
I have stirred him up in righteousness and I will make all his ways level he shall build my city and set my exiles free not for price or reward says the LORD of hosts
Thus says the LORD The wealth of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush and the Sabeans men of stature shall come over to you and be yours they shall follow you they shall come over in chains and bow down to you They will plead with you saying Surely God is in you and there is no other no god besides him
Truly you are a God who hides himself O God of Israel the Savior
All of them are put to shame and confounded the makers of idols go in confusion together
But Israel is saved by the LORD with everlasting salvation you shall not be put to shame or confounded to all eternity
For thus says the LORD who created the heavens he is God who formed the earth and made it he established it he did not create it empty he formed it to be inhabited I am the LORD and there is no other
I did not speak in secret in a land of darkness I did not say to the offspring of Jacob Seek me in vain I the LORD speak the truth I declare what is right
Assemble yourselves and come draw near together you survivors of the nations They have no knowledge who carry about their wooden idols and keep on praying to a god that cannot save
Declare and present your case let them take counsel together Who told this long ago Who declared it of old Was it not I the LORD And there is no other god besides me a righteous God and a Savior there is none besides me
Turn to me and be saved all the ends of the earth For I am God and there is no other
By myself I have sworn from my mouth has gone out in righteousness a word that shall not return To me every knee shall bow every tongue shall swear allegiance
Only in the LORD it shall be said of me are righteousness and strength to him shall come and be ashamed all who were incensed against him
In the LORD all the offspring of Israel shall be justified and shall glory
