Isaiah 24
Behold the LORD will empty the earth and make it desolate and he will twist its surface and scatter its inhabitants
And it shall be as with the people so with the priest as with the slave so with his master as with the maid so with her mistress as with the buyer so with the seller as with the lender so with the borrower as with the creditor so with the debtor
The earth shall be utterly empty and utterly plundered for the LORD has spoken this word
The earth mourns and withers the world languishes and withers the highest people of the earth languish
The earth lies defiled under its inhabitants for they have transgressed the laws violated the statutes broken the everlasting covenant
Therefore a curse devours the earth and its inhabitants suffer for their guilt therefore the inhabitants of the earth are scorched and few men are left
The wine mourns the vine languishes all the merry hearted sigh
The mirth of the tambourines is stilled the noise of the jubilant has ceased the mirth of the lyre is stilled
No more do they drink wine with singing strong drink is bitter to those who drink it
The wasted city is broken down every house is shut up so that none can enter
There is an outcry in the streets for lack of wine all joy has grown dark the gladness of the earth is banished
Desolation is left in the city the gates are battered into ruins
For thus it shall be in the midst of the earth among the nations as when an olive tree is beaten as at the gleaning when the grape harvest is done
They lift up their voices they sing for joy over the majesty of the LORD they shout from the west
Therefore in the east give glory to the LORD in the coastlands of the sea give glory to the name of the LORD the God of Israel
From the ends of the earth we hear songs of praise of glory to the Righteous One But I say I waste away I waste away Woe is me For the traitors have betrayed with betrayal the traitors have betrayed
Terror and the pit and the snare are upon you O inhabitant of the earth
He who flees at the sound of the terror shall fall into the pit and he who climbs out of the pit shall be caught in the snare For the windows of heaven are opened and the foundations of the earth tremble
The earth is utterly broken the earth is split apart the earth is violently shaken
The earth staggers like a drunken man it sways like a hut its transgression lies heavy upon it and it falls and will not rise again
On that day the LORD will punish the host of heaven in heaven and the kings of the earth on the earth
They will be gathered together as prisoners in a pit they will be shut up in a prison and after many days they will be punished
Then the moon will be confounded and the sun ashamed for the LORD of hosts reigns on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem and his glory will be before his elders
