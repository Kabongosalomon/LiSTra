2 Chronicles 3
Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah where the LORD had appeared to David his father at the place that David had appointed on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite
He began to build in the second month of the fourth year of his reign
These are Solomon s measurements for building the house of God the length in cubits of the old standard was sixty cubits and the breadth twenty cubits
The vestibule in front of the nave of the house was twenty cubits long equal to the width of the house and its height was cubits He overlaid it on the inside with pure gold
The nave he lined with cypress and covered it with fine gold and made palms and chains on it
He adorned the house with settings of precious stones The gold was gold of Parvaim
So he lined the house with gold its beams its thresholds its walls and its doors and he carved cherubim on the walls
And he made the Most Holy Place Its length corresponding to the breadth of the house was twenty cubits and its breadth was twenty cubits He overlaid it with talents of fine gold
The weight of gold for the nails was fifty shekels And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold
In the Most Holy Place he made two cherubim of wood and overlaid them with gold
The wings of the cherubim together extended twenty cubits one wing of the one of five cubits touched the wall of the house and its other wing of five cubits touched the wing of the other cherub
and of this cherub one wing of five cubits touched the wall of the house and the other wing also of five cubits was joined to the wing of the first cherub
The wings of these cherubim extended twenty cubits The cherubim stood on their feet facing the nave
And he made the veil of blue and purple and crimson fabrics and fine linen and he worked cherubim on it
In front of the house he made two pillars thirty five cubits high with a capital of five cubits on the top of each
He made chains like a necklace and put them on the tops of the pillars and he made a hundred pomegranates and put them on the chains
He set up the pillars in front of the temple one on the south the other on the north that on the south he called Jachin and that on the north Boaz
