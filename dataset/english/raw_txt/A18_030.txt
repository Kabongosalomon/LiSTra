Job 30
But now they laugh at me men who are younger than I whose fathers I would have disdained to set with the dogs of my flock
What could I gain from the strength of their hands men whose vigor is gone
Through want and hard hunger they gnaw the dry ground by night in waste and desolation
they pick saltwort and the leaves of bushes and the roots of the broom tree for their food
They are driven out from human company they shout after them as after a thief
In the gullies of the torrents they must dwell in holes of the earth and of the rocks
Among the bushes they bray under the nettles they huddle together
A senseless a nameless brood they have been whipped out of the land
And now I have become their song I am a byword to them
They abhor me they keep aloof from me they do not hesitate to spit at the sight of me
Because God has loosed my cord and humbled me they have cast off restraint in my presence
On my right hand the rabble rise they push away my feet they cast up against me their ways of destruction
They break up my path they promote my calamity they need no one to help them
As through a wide breach they come amid the crash they roll on
Terrors are turned upon me my honor is pursued as by the wind and my prosperity has passed away like a cloud
And now my soul is poured out within me days of affliction have taken hold of me
The night racks my bones and the pain that gnaws me takes no rest
With great force my garment is disfigured it binds me about like the collar of my tunic
God has cast me into the mire and I have become like dust and ashes
I cry to you for help and you do not answer me I stand and you only look at me
You have turned cruel to me with the might of your hand you persecute me
You lift me up on the wind you make me ride on it and you toss me about in the roar of the storm
For I know that you will bring me to death and to the house appointed for all living
Yet does not one in a heap of ruins stretch out his hand and in his disaster cry for help
Did not I weep for him whose day was hard Was not my soul grieved for the needy
But when I hoped for good evil came and when I waited for light darkness came
My inward parts are in turmoil and never still days of affliction come to meet me
I go about darkened but not by the sun I stand up in the assembly and cry for help
I am a brother of jackals and a companion of ostriches
My skin turns black and falls from me and my bones burn with heat
My lyre is turned to mourning and my pipe to the voice of those who weep
