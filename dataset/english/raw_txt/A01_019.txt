Genesis 19
The two angels came to Sodom in the evening and Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom When Lot saw them he rose to meet them and bowed himself with his face to the earth
and said My lords please turn aside to your servant s house and spend the night and wash your feet Then you may rise up early and go on your way They said No we will spend the night in the town square
But he pressed them strongly so they turned aside to him and entered his house And he made them a feast and baked unleavened bread and they ate
But before they lay down the men of the city the men of Sodom both young and old all the people to the last man surrounded the house
And they called to Lot Where are the men who came to you tonight Bring them out to us that we may know them
Lot went out to the men at the entrance shut the door after him
and said I beg you my brothers do not act so wickedly
Behold I have two daughters who have not known any man Let me bring them out to you and do to them as you please Only do nothing to these men for they have come under the shelter of my roof
But they said Stand back And they said This fellow came to sojourn and he has become the judge Now we will deal worse with you than with them Then they pressed hard against the man Lot and drew near to break the door down
But the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them and shut the door
And they struck with blindness the men who were at the entrance of the house both small and great so that they wore themselves out groping for the door
Then the men said to Lot Have you anyone else here Sons in law sons daughters or anyone you have in the city bring them out of the place
For we are about to destroy this place because the outcry against its people has become great before the LORD and the LORD has sent us to destroy it
So Lot went out and said to his sons in law who were to marry his daughters Up Get out of this place for the LORD is about to destroy the city But he seemed to his sons in law to be jesting
As morning dawned the angels urged Lot saying Up Take your wife and your two daughters who are here lest you be swept away in the punishment of the city
But he lingered So the men seized him and his wife and his two daughters by the hand the LORD being merciful to him and they brought him out and set him outside the city
And as they brought them out one said Escape for your life Do not look back or stop anywhere in the valley Escape to the hills lest you be swept away
And Lot said to them Oh no my lords
Behold your servant has found favor in your sight and you have shown me great kindness in saving my life But I cannot escape to the hills lest the disaster overtake me and I die
Behold this city is near enough to flee to and it is a little one Let me escape there is it not a little one and my life will be saved
He said to him Behold I grant you this favor also that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken
Escape there quickly for I can do nothing till you arrive there Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar
The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar
Then the LORD rained on Sodom and Gomorrah sulfur and fire from the LORD out of heaven
And he overthrew those cities and all the valley and all the inhabitants of the cities and what grew on the ground
But Lot s wife behind him looked back and she became a pillar of salt
And Abraham went early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the LORD
And he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the valley and he looked and behold the smoke of the land went up like the smoke of a furnace
So it was that when God destroyed the cities of the valley God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which Lot had lived
Now Lot went up out of Zoar and lived in the hills with his two daughters for he was afraid to live in Zoar So he lived in a cave with his two daughters
And the firstborn said to the younger Our father is old and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth
Come let us make our father drink wine and we will lie with him that we may preserve offspring from our father
So they made their father drink wine that night And the firstborn went in and lay with her father He did not know when she lay down or when she arose
The next day the firstborn said to the younger Behold I lay last night with my father Let us make him drink wine tonight also Then you go in and lie with him that we may preserve offspring from our father
So they made their father drink wine that night also And the younger arose and lay with him and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose
Thus both the daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father
The firstborn bore a son and called his name Moab He is the father of the Moabites to this day
The younger also bore a son and called his name Ben ammi He is the father of the Ammonites to this day
