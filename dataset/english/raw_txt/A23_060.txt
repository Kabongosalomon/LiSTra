Isaiah 60
Arise shine for your light has come and the glory of the LORD has risen upon you
For behold darkness shall cover the earth and thick darkness the peoples but the LORD will arise upon you and his glory will be seen upon you
And nations shall come to your light and kings to the brightness of your rising
Lift up your eyes all around and see they all gather together they come to you your sons shall come from afar and your daughters shall be carried on the hip
Then you shall see and be radiant your heart shall thrill and exult because the abundance of the sea shall be turned to you the wealth of the nations shall come to you
A multitude of camels shall cover you the young camels of Midian and Ephah all those from Sheba shall come They shall bring gold and frankincense and shall bring good news the praises of the LORD
All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered to you the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you they shall come up with acceptance on my altar and I will beautify my beautiful house
Who are these that fly like a cloud and like doves to their windows
For the coastlands shall hope for me the ships of Tarshish first to bring your children from afar their silver and gold with them for the name of the LORD your God and for the Holy One of Israel because he has made you beautiful
Foreigners shall build up your walls and their kings shall minister to you for in my wrath I struck you but in my favor I have had mercy on you
Your gates shall be open continually day and night they shall not be shut that people may bring to you the wealth of the nations with their kings led in procession
For the nation and kingdom that will not serve you shall perish those nations shall be utterly laid waste
The glory of Lebanon shall come to you the cypress the plane and the pine to beautify the place of my sanctuary and I will make the place of my feet glorious
The sons of those who afflicted you shall come bending low to you and all who despised you shall bow down at your feet they shall call you the City of the LORD the Zion of the Holy One of Israel
Whereas you have been forsaken and hated with no one passing through I will make you majestic forever a joy from age to age
You shall suck the milk of nations you shall nurse at the breast of kings and you shall know that I the LORD am your Savior and your Redeemer the Mighty One of Jacob
Instead of bronze I will bring gold and instead of iron I will bring silver instead of wood bronze instead of stones iron I will make your overseers peace and your taskmasters righteousness
Violence shall no more be heard in your land devastation or destruction within your borders you shall call your walls Salvation and your gates Praise
The sun shall be no more your light by day nor for brightness shall the moon give you light but the LORD will be your everlasting light and your God will be your glory
Your sun shall no more go down nor your moon withdraw itself for the LORD will be your everlasting light and your days of mourning shall be ended
Your people shall all be righteous they shall possess the land forever the branch of my planting the work of my hands that I might be glorified
The least one shall become a clan and the smallest one a mighty nation I am the LORD in its time I will hasten it
