Isaiah 64
Oh that you would rend the heavens and come down that the mountains might quake at your presence
as when fire kindles brushwood and the fire causes water to boil to make your name known to your adversaries and that the nations might tremble at your presence
When you did awesome things that we did not look for you came down the mountains quaked at your presence
From of old no one has heard or perceived by the ear no eye has seen a God besides you who acts for those who wait for him
You meet him who joyfully works righteousness those who remember you in your ways Behold you were angry and we sinned in our sins we have been a long time and shall we be saved
We have all become like one who is unclean and all our righteous deeds are like a polluted garment We all fade like a leaf and our iniquities like the wind take us away
There is no one who calls upon your name who rouses himself to take hold of you for you have hidden your face from us and have made us melt in the hand of our iniquities
But now O LORD you are our Father we are the clay and you are our potter we are all the work of your hand
Be not so terribly angry O LORD and remember not iniquity forever Behold please look we are all your people
Your holy cities have become a wilderness Zion has become a wilderness Jerusalem a desolation
Our holy and beautiful house where our fathers praised you has been burned by fire and all our pleasant places have become ruins
Will you restrain yourself at these things O LORD Will you keep silent and afflict us so terribly
