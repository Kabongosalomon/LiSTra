Genesis 29
Then Jacob went on his journey and came to the land of the people of the east
As he looked he saw a well in the field and behold three flocks of sheep lying beside it for out of that well the flocks were watered The stone on the well s mouth was large
and when all the flocks were gathered there the shepherds would roll the stone from the mouth of the well and water the sheep and put the stone back in its place over the mouth of the well
Jacob said to them My brothers where do you come from They said We are from Haran
He said to them Do you know Laban the son of Nahor They said We know him
He said to them Is it well with him They said It is well and see Rachel his daughter is coming with the sheep
He said Behold it is still high day it is not time for the livestock to be gathered together Water the sheep and go pasture them
But they said We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together and the stone is rolled from the mouth of the well then we water the sheep
While he was still speaking with them Rachel came with her father s sheep for she was a shepherdess
Now as soon as Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother s brother and the sheep of Laban his mother s brother Jacob came near and rolled the stone from the well s mouth and watered the flock of Laban his mother s brother
Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept aloud
And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father s kinsman and that he was Rebekah s son and she ran and told her father
As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob his sister s son he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house Jacob told Laban all these things
and Laban said to him Surely you are my bone and my flesh And he stayed with him a month
Then Laban said to Jacob Because you are my kinsman should you therefore serve me for nothing Tell me what shall your wages be
Now Laban had two daughters The name of the older was Leah and the name of the younger was Rachel
Leah s eyes were weak but Rachel was beautiful in form and appearance
Jacob loved Rachel And he said I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel
Laban said It is better that I give her to you than that I should give her to any other man stay with me
So Jacob served seven years for Rachel and they seemed to him but a few days because of the love he had for her
Then Jacob said to Laban Give me my wife that I may go in to her for my time is completed
So Laban gathered together all the people of the place and made a feast
But in the evening he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob and he went in to her
Laban gave his female servant Zilpah to his daughter Leah to be her servant
And in the morning behold it was Leah And Jacob said to Laban What is this you have done to me Did I not serve with you for Rachel Why then have you deceived me
Laban said It is not so done in our country to give the younger before the firstborn
Complete the week of this one and we will give you the other also in return for serving me another seven years
Jacob did so and completed her week Then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife
Laban gave his female servant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel to be her servant
So Jacob went in to Rachel also and he loved Rachel more than Leah and served Laban for another seven years
When the LORD saw that Leah was hated he opened her womb but Rachel was barren
And Leah conceived and bore a son and she called his name Reuben for she said Because the LORD has looked upon my affliction for now my husband will love me
She conceived again and bore a son and said Because the LORD has heard that I am hated he has given me this son also And she called his name Simeon
Again she conceived and bore a son and said Now this time my husband will be attached to me because I have borne him three sons Therefore his name was called Levi
And she conceived again and bore a son and said This time I will praise the LORD Therefore she called his name Judah Then she ceased bearing
