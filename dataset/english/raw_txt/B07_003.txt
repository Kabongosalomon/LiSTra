1 Corienthians 3
But I brothers could not address you as spiritual people but as people of the flesh as infants in Christ
I fed you with milk not solid food for you were not ready for it And even now you are not yet ready
for you are still of the flesh For while there is jealousy and strife among you are you not of the flesh and behaving only in a human way
For when one says I follow Paul and another I follow Apollos are you not being merely human
What then is Apollos What is Paul Servants through whom you believed as the Lord assigned to each
I planted Apollos watered but God gave the growth
So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything but only God who gives the growth
He who plants and he who waters are one and each will receive his wages according to his labor
For we are God s fellow workers You are God s field God s building
According to the grace of God given to me like a skilled master builder I laid a foundation and someone else is building upon it Let each one take care how he builds upon it
For no one can lay a foundation other than that which is laid which is Jesus Christ
Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold silver precious stones wood hay straw
each one s work will become manifest for the Day will disclose it because it will be revealed by fire and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done
If the work that anyone has built on the foundation survives he will receive a reward
If anyone s work is burned up he will suffer loss though he himself will be saved but only as through fire
Do you not know that you are God s temple and that God s Spirit dwells in you
If anyone destroys God s temple God will destroy him For God s temple is holy and you are that temple
Let no one deceive himself If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age let him become a fool that he may become wise
For the wisdom of this world is folly with God For it is written He catches the wise in their craftiness
and again The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise that they are futile
So let no one boast in men For all things are yours
whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future all are yours
and you are Christ s and Christ is God s
