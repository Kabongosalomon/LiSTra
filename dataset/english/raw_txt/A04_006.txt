Numbers 6
And the LORD spoke to Moses saying
Speak to the people of Israel and say to them When either a man or a woman makes a special vow the vow of a Nazirite to separate himself to the LORD
he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink He shall drink no vinegar made from wine or strong drink and shall not drink any juice of grapes or eat grapes fresh or dried
All the days of his separation he shall eat nothing that is produced by the grapevine not even the seeds or the skins
All the days of his vow of separation no razor shall touch his head Until the time is completed for which he separates himself to the LORD he shall be holy He shall let the locks of hair of his head grow long
All the days that he separates himself to the LORD he shall not go near a dead body
Not even for his father or for his mother for brother or sister if they die shall he make himself unclean because his separation to God is on his head
All the days of his separation he is holy to the LORD
And if any man dies very suddenly beside him and he defiles his consecrated head then he shall shave his head on the day of his cleansing on the seventh day he shall shave it
On the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two pigeons to the priest to the entrance of the tent of meeting
and the priest shall offer one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering and make atonement for him because he sinned by reason of the dead body And he shall consecrate his head that same day
and separate himself to the LORD for the days of his separation and bring a male lamb a year old for a guilt offering But the previous period shall be void because his separation was defiled
And this is the law for the Nazirite when the time of his separation has been completed he shall be brought to the entrance of the tent of meeting
and he shall bring his gift to the LORD one male lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering and one ewe lamb a year old without blemish as a sin offering and one ram without blemish as a peace offering
and a basket of unleavened bread loaves of fine flour mixed with oil and unleavened wafers smeared with oil and their grain offering and their drink offerings
And the priest shall bring them before the LORD and offer his sin offering and his burnt offering
and he shall offer the ram as a sacrifice of peace offering to the LORD with the basket of unleavened bread The priest shall offer also its grain offering and its drink offering
And the Nazirite shall shave his consecrated head at the entrance of the tent of meeting and shall take the hair from his consecrated head and put it on the fire that is under the sacrifice of the peace offering
And the priest shall take the shoulder of the ram when it is boiled and one unleavened loaf out of the basket and one unleavened wafer and shall put them on the hands of the Nazirite after he has shaved the hair of his consecration
and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD They are a holy portion for the priest together with the breast that is waved and the thigh that is contributed And after that the Nazirite may drink wine
This is the law of the Nazirite But if he vows an offering to the LORD above his Nazirite vow as he can afford in exact accordance with the vow that he takes then he shall do in addition to the law of the Nazirite
The LORD spoke to Moses saying
Speak to Aaron and his sons saying Thus you shall bless the people of Israel you shall say to them
The LORD bless you and keep you
the LORD make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you
the LORD lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace
So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel and I will bless them
