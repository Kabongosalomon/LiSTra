Zechariah 8
And the word of the LORD of hosts came saying
Thus says the LORD of hosts I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy and I am jealous for her with great wrath
Thus says the LORD I have returned to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem and Jerusalem shall be called the faithful city and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain
Thus says the LORD of hosts Old men and old women shall again sit in the streets of Jerusalem each with staff in hand because of great age
And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in its streets
Thus says the LORD of hosts If it is marvelous in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days should it also be marvelous in my sight declares the LORD of hosts
Thus says the LORD of hosts behold I will save my people from the east country and from the west country
and I will bring them to dwell in the midst of Jerusalem And they shall be my people and I will be their God in faithfulness and in righteousness
Thus says the LORD of hosts Let your hands be strong you who in these days have been hearing these words from the mouth of the prophets who were present on the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid that the temple might be built
For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for beast neither was there any safety from the foe for him who went out or came in for I set every man against his neighbor
But now I will not deal with the remnant of this people as in the former days declares the LORD of hosts
For there shall be a sowing of peace The vine shall give its fruit and the ground shall give its produce and the heavens shall give their dew And I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things
And as you have been a byword of cursing among the nations O house of Judah and house of Israel so will I save you and you shall be a blessing Fear not but let your hands be strong
For thus says the LORD of hosts As I purposed to bring disaster to you when your fathers provoked me to wrath and I did not relent says the LORD of hosts
so again have I purposed in these days to bring good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah fear not
These are the things that you shall do Speak the truth to one another render in your gates judgments that are true and make for peace
do not devise evil in your hearts against one another and love no false oath for all these things I hate declares the LORD
And the word of the LORD of hosts came to me saying
Thus says the LORD of hosts The fast of the fourth month and the fast of the fifth and the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth shall be to the house of Judah seasons of joy and gladness and cheerful feasts Therefore love truth and peace
Thus says the LORD of hosts Peoples shall yet come even the inhabitants of many cities
The inhabitants of one city shall go to another saying Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD and to seek the LORD of hosts I myself am going
Many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the LORD
Thus says the LORD of hosts In those days ten men from the nations of every tongue shall take hold of the robe of a Jew saying Let us go with you for we have heard that God is with you
