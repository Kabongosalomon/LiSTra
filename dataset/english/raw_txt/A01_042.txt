Genesis 42
When Jacob learned that there was grain for sale in Egypt he said to his sons Why do you look at one another
And he said Behold I have heard that there is grain for sale in Egypt Go down and buy grain for us there that we may live and not die
So ten of Joseph s brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt
But Jacob did not send Benjamin Joseph s brother with his brothers for he feared that harm might happen to him
Thus the sons of Israel came to buy among the others who came for the famine was in the land of Canaan
Now Joseph was governor over the land He was the one who sold to all the people of the land And Joseph s brothers came and bowed themselves before him with their faces to the ground
Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them but he treated them like strangers and spoke roughly to them Where do you come from he said They said From the land of Canaan to buy food
And Joseph recognized his brothers but they did not recognize him
And Joseph remembered the dreams that he had dreamed of them And he said to them You are spies you have come to see the nakedness of the land
They said to him No my lord your servants have come to buy food
We are all sons of one man We are honest men Your servants have never been spies
He said to them No it is the nakedness of the land that you have come to see
And they said We your servants are twelve brothers the sons of one man in the land of Canaan and behold the youngest is this day with our father and one is no more
But Joseph said to them It is as I said to you You are spies
By this you shall be tested by the life of Pharaoh you shall not go from this place unless your youngest brother comes here
Send one of you and let him bring your brother while you remain confined that your words may be tested whether there is truth in you Or else by the life of Pharaoh surely you are spies
And he put them all together in custody for three days
On the third day Joseph said to them Do this and you will live for I fear God
if you are honest men let one of your brothers remain confined where you are in custody and let the rest go and carry grain for the famine of your households
and bring your youngest brother to me So your words will be verified and you shall not die And they did so
Then they said to one another In truth we are guilty concerning our brother in that we saw the distress of his soul when he begged us and we did not listen That is why this distress has come upon us
And Reuben answered them Did I not tell you not to sin against the boy But you did not listen So now there comes a reckoning for his blood
They did not know that Joseph understood them for there was an interpreter between them
Then he turned away from them and wept And he returned to them and spoke to them And he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes
And Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain and to replace every man s money in his sack and to give them provisions for the journey This was done for them
Then they loaded their donkeys with their grain and departed
And as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey fodder at the lodging place he saw his money in the mouth of his sack
He said to his brothers My money has been put back here it is in the mouth of my sack At this their hearts failed them and they turned trembling to one another saying What is this that God has done to us
When they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan they told him all that had happened to them saying
The man the lord of the land spoke roughly to us and took us to be spies of the land
But we said to him We are honest men we have never been spies
We are twelve brothers sons of our father One is no more and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan
Then the man the lord of the land said to us By this I shall know that you are honest men leave one of your brothers with me and take grain for the famine of your households and go your way
Bring your youngest brother to me Then I shall know that you are not spies but honest men and I will deliver your brother to you and you shall trade in the land
As they emptied their sacks behold every man s bundle of money was in his sack And when they and their father saw their bundles of money they were afraid
And Jacob their father said to them You have bereaved me of my children Joseph is no more and Simeon is no more and now you would take Benjamin All this has come against me
Then Reuben said to his father Kill my two sons if I do not bring him back to you Put him in my hands and I will bring him back to you
But he said My son shall not go down with you for his brother is dead and he is the only one left If harm should happen to him on the journey that you are to make you would bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol
