Proverbs 2
My son if you receive my words and treasure up my commandments with you
making your ear attentive to wisdom and inclining your heart to understanding
yes if you call out for insight and raise your voice for understanding
if you seek it like silver and search for it as for hidden treasures
then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God
For the LORD gives wisdom from his mouth come knowledge and understanding
he stores up sound wisdom for the upright he is a shield to those who walk in integrity
guarding the paths of justice and watching over the way of his saints
Then you will understand righteousness and justice and equity every good path
for wisdom will come into your heart and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul
discretion will watch over you understanding will guard you
delivering you from the way of evil from men of perverted speech
who forsake the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness
who rejoice in doing evil and delight in the perverseness of evil
men whose paths are crooked and who are devious in their ways
So you will be delivered from the forbidden woman from the adulteress with her smooth words
who forsakes the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God
for her house sinks down to death and her paths to the departed
none who go to her come back nor do they regain the paths of life
So you will walk in the way of the good and keep to the paths of the righteous
For the upright will inhabit the land and those with integrity will remain in it
but the wicked will be cut off from the land and the treacherous will be rooted out of it
