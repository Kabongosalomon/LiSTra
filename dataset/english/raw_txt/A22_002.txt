Song of Solomon 2
I am a rose of Sharon a lily of the valleys HE
As a lily among brambles so is my love among the young women SHE
As an apple tree among the trees of the forest so is my beloved among the young men With great delight I sat in his shadow and his fruit was sweet to my taste
He brought me to the banqueting house and his banner over me was love
Sustain me with raisins refresh me with apples for I am sick with love
His left hand is under my head and his right hand embraces me
I adjure you O daughters of Jerusalem by the gazelles or the does of the field that you not stir up or awaken love until it pleases
The voice of my beloved Behold he comes leaping over the mountains bounding over the hills
My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag Behold there he stands behind our wall gazing through the windows looking through the lattice
My beloved speaks and says to me Arise my love my beautiful one and come away
for behold the winter is past the rain is over and gone
The flowers appear on the earth the time of singing has come and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land
The fig tree ripens its figs and the vines are in blossom they give forth fragrance Arise my love my beautiful one and come away
O my dove in the clefts of the rock in the crannies of the cliff let me see your face let me hear your voice for your voice is sweet and your face is lovely
Catch the foxes for us the little foxes that spoil the vineyards for our vineyards are in blossom
My beloved is mine and I am his he grazes among the lilies
Until the day breathes and the shadows flee turn my beloved be like a gazelle or a young stag on cleft mountains
