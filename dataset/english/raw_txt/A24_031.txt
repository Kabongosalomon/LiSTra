Jeremiah 31
At that time declares the LORD I will be the God of all the clans of Israel and they shall be my people
Thus says the LORD The people who survived the sword found grace in the wilderness when Israel sought for rest
the LORD appeared to him from far away I have loved you with an everlasting love therefore I have continued my faithfulness to you
Again I will build you and you shall be built O virgin Israel Again you shall adorn yourself with tambourines and shall go forth in the dance of the merrymakers
Again you shall plant vineyards on the mountains of Samaria the planters shall plant and shall enjoy the fruit
For there shall be a day when watchmen will call in the hill country of Ephraim Arise and let us go up to Zion to the LORD our God
For thus says the LORD Sing aloud with gladness for Jacob and raise shouts for the chief of the nations proclaim give praise and say O LORD save your people the remnant of Israel
Behold I will bring them from the north country and gather them from the farthest parts of the earth among them the blind and the lame the pregnant woman and she who is in labor together a great company they shall return here
With weeping they shall come and with pleas for mercy I will lead them back I will make them walk by brooks of water in a straight path in which they shall not stumble for I am a father to Israel and Ephraim is my firstborn
Hear the word of the LORD O nations and declare it in the coastlands far away say He who scattered Israel will gather him and will keep him as a shepherd keeps his flock
For the LORD has ransomed Jacob and has redeemed him from hands too strong for him
They shall come and sing aloud on the height of Zion and they shall be radiant over the goodness of the LORD over the grain the wine and the oil and over the young of the flock and the herd their life shall be like a watered garden and they shall languish no more
Then shall the young women rejoice in the dance and the young men and the old shall be merry I will turn their mourning into joy I will comfort them and give them gladness for sorrow
I will feast the soul of the priests with abundance and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness declares the LORD
Thus says the LORD A voice is heard in Ramah lamentation and bitter weeping Rachel is weeping for her children she refuses to be comforted for her children because they are no more
Thus says the LORD Keep your voice from weeping and your eyes from tears for there is a reward for your work declares the LORD and they shall come back from the land of the enemy
There is hope for your future declares the LORD and your children shall come back to their own country
I have heard Ephraim grieving You have disciplined me and I was disciplined like an untrained calf bring me back that I may be restored for you are the LORD my God
For after I had turned away I relented and after I was instructed I struck my thigh I was ashamed and I was confounded because I bore the disgrace of my youth
Is Ephraim my dear son Is he my darling child For as often as I speak against him I do remember him still Therefore my heart yearns for him I will surely have mercy on him declares the LORD
Set up road markers for yourself make yourself guideposts consider well the highway the road by which you went Return O virgin Israel return to these your cities
How long will you waver O faithless daughter For the LORD has created a new thing on the earth a woman encircles a man
Thus says the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Once more they shall use these words in the land of Judah and in its cities when I restore their fortunes The LORD bless you O habitation of righteousness O holy hill
And Judah and all its cities shall dwell there together and the farmers and those who wander with their flocks
For I will satisfy the weary soul and every languishing soul I will replenish
At this I awoke and looked and my sleep was pleasant to me
Behold the days are coming declares the LORD when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and the seed of beast
And it shall come to pass that as I have watched over them to pluck up and break down to overthrow destroy and bring harm so I will watch over them to build and to plant declares the LORD
In those days they shall no longer say The fathers have eaten sour grapes and the children s teeth are set on edge
But everyone shall die for his own sin Each man who eats sour grapes his teeth shall be set on edge
Behold the days are coming declares the LORD when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah
not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt my covenant that they broke though I was their husband declares the LORD
But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days declares the LORD I will put my law within them and I will write it on their hearts And I will be their God and they shall be my people
And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother saying Know the LORD for they shall all know me from the least of them to the greatest declares the LORD For I will forgive their iniquity and I will remember their sin no more
Thus says the LORD who gives the sun for light by day and the fixed order of the moon and the stars for light by night who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar the LORD of hosts is his name
If this fixed order departs from before me declares the LORD then shall the offspring of Israel cease from being a nation before me forever
Thus says the LORD If the heavens above can be measured and the foundations of the earth below can be explored then I will cast off all the offspring of Israel for all that they have done declares the LORD
Behold the days are coming declares the LORD when the city shall be rebuilt for the LORD from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate
And the measuring line shall go out farther straight to the hill Gareb and shall then turn to Goah
The whole valley of the dead bodies and the ashes and all the fields as far as the brook Kidron to the corner of the Horse Gate toward the east shall be sacred to the LORD It shall not be uprooted or overthrown anymore forever
