Amos 7
This is what the Lord GOD showed me behold he was forming locusts when the latter growth was just beginning to sprout and behold it was the latter growth after the king s mowings
When they had finished eating the grass of the land I said O Lord GOD please forgive How can Jacob stand He is so small
The LORD relented concerning this It shall not be said the LORD
This is what the Lord GOD showed me behold the Lord GOD was calling for a judgment by fire and it devoured the great deep and was eating up the land
Then I said O Lord GOD please cease How can Jacob stand He is so small
The LORD relented concerning this This also shall not be said the Lord GOD
This is what he showed me behold the Lord was standing beside a wall built with a plumb line with a plumb line in his hand
And the LORD said to me Amos what do you see And I said A plumb line Then the Lord said Behold I am setting a plumb line in the midst of my people Israel I will never again pass by them
the high places of Isaac shall be made desolate and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword
Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel saying Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel The land is not able to bear all his words
For thus Amos has said Jeroboam shall die by the sword and Israel must go into exile away from his land
And Amaziah said to Amos O seer go flee away to the land of Judah and eat bread there and prophesy there
but never again prophesy at Bethel for it is the king s sanctuary and it is a temple of the kingdom
Then Amos answered and said to Amaziah I was no prophet nor a prophet s son but I was a herdsman and a dresser of sycamore figs
But the LORD took me from following the flock and the LORD said to me Go prophesy to my people Israel
Now therefore hear the word of the LORD You say Do not prophesy against Israel and do not preach against the house of Isaac
Therefore thus says the LORD Your wife shall be a prostitute in the city and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword and your land shall be divided up with a measuring line you yourself shall die in an unclean land and Israel shall surely go into exile away from its land
