1 Samuel 31
Now the Philistines fought against Israel and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines and fell slain on Mount Gilboa
And the Philistines overtook Saul and his sons and the Philistines struck down Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchi shua the sons of Saul
The battle pressed hard against Saul and the archers found him and he was badly wounded by the archers
Then Saul said to his armor bearer Draw your sword and thrust me through with it lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through and mistreat me But his armor bearer would not for he feared greatly Therefore Saul took his own sword and fell upon it
And when his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead he also fell upon his sword and died with him
Thus Saul died and his three sons and his armor bearer and all his men on the same day together
And when the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley and those beyond the Jordan saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead they abandoned their cities and fled And the Philistines came and lived in them
The next day when the Philistines came to strip the slain they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa
So they cut off his head and stripped off his armor and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to carry the good news to the house of their idols and to the people
They put his armor in the temple of Ashtaroth and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth shan
But when the inhabitants of Jabesh gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul
all the valiant men arose and went all night and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth shan and they came to Jabesh and burned them there
And they took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh and fasted seven days
