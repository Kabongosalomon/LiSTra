1 Corienthians 4
This is how one should regard us as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God
Moreover it is required of stewards that they be found trustworthy
But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human court In fact I do not even judge myself
For I am not aware of anything against myself but I am not thereby acquitted It is the Lord who judges me
Therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time before the Lord comes who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart Then each one will receive his commendation from God
I have applied all these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit brothers that you may learn by us not to go beyond what is written that none of you may be puffed up in favor of one against another
For who sees anything different in you What do you have that you did not receive If then you received it why do you boast as if you did not receive it
Already you have all you want Already you have become rich Without us you have become kings And would that you did reign so that we might share the rule with you
For I think that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all like men sentenced to death because we have become a spectacle to the world to angels and to men
We are fools for Christ s sake but you are wise in Christ We are weak but you are strong You are held in honor but we in disrepute
To the present hour we hunger and thirst we are poorly dressed and buffeted and homeless
and we labor working with our own hands When reviled we bless when persecuted we endure
when slandered we entreat We have become and are still like the scum of the world the refuse of all things
I do not write these things to make you ashamed but to admonish you as my beloved children
For though you have countless guides in Christ you do not have many fathers For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel
I urge you then be imitators of me
That is why I sent you Timothy my beloved and faithful child in the Lord to remind you of my ways in Christ as I teach them everywhere in every church
Some are arrogant as though I were not coming to you
But I will come to you soon if the Lord wills and I will find out not the talk of these arrogant people but their power
For the kingdom of God does not consist in talk but in power
What do you wish Shall I come to you with a rod or with love in a spirit of gentleness
