1 Kings 14
At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick
And Jeroboam said to his wife Arise and disguise yourself that it not be known that you are the wife of Jeroboam and go to Shiloh Behold Ahijah the prophet is there who said of me that I should be king over this people
Take with you ten loaves some cakes and a jar of honey and go to him He will tell you what shall happen to the child
Jeroboam s wife did so She arose and went to Shiloh and came to the house of Ahijah Now Ahijah could not see for his eyes were dim because of his age
And the LORD said to Ahijah Behold the wife of Jeroboam is coming to inquire of you concerning her son for he is sick Thus and thus shall you say to her When she came she pretended to be another woman
But when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came in at the door he said Come in wife of Jeroboam Why do you pretend to be another For I am charged with unbearable news for you
Go tell Jeroboam Thus says the LORD the God of Israel Because I exalted you from among the people and made you leader over my people Israel
and tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you and yet you have not been like my servant David who kept my commandments and followed me with all his heart doing only that which was right in my eyes
but you have done evil above all who were before you and have gone and made for yourself other gods and metal images provoking me to anger and have cast me behind your back
therefore behold I will bring harm upon the house of Jeroboam and will cut off from Jeroboam every male both bond and free in Israel and will burn up the house of Jeroboam as a man burns up dung until it is all gone
Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city the dogs shall eat and anyone who dies in the open country the birds of the heavens shall eat for the LORD has spoken it
Arise therefore go to your house When your feet enter the city the child shall die
And all Israel shall mourn for him and bury him for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave because in him there is found something pleasing to the LORD the God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam
Moreover the LORD will raise up for himself a king over Israel who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam today And henceforth
the LORD will strike Israel as a reed is shaken in the water and root up Israel out of this good land that he gave to their fathers and scatter them beyond the Euphrates because they have made their Asherim provoking the LORD to anger
And he will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned and made Israel to sin
Then Jeroboam s wife arose and departed and came to Tirzah And as she came to the threshold of the house the child died
And all Israel buried him and mourned for him according to the word of the LORD which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the prophet
Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam how he warred and how he reigned behold they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel
And the time that Jeroboam reigned was twenty two years And he slept with his fathers and Nadab his son reigned in his place
Now Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah Rehoboam was forty one years old when he began to reign and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem the city that the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there His mother s name was Naamah the Ammonite
And Judah did what was evil in the sight of the LORD and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins that they committed more than all that their fathers had done
For they also built for themselves high places and pillars and Asherim on every high hill and under every green tree
and there were also male cult prostitutes in the land They did according to all the abominations of the nations that the LORD drove out before the people of Israel
In the fifth year of King Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem
He took away the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king s house He took away everything He also took away all the shields of gold that Solomon had made
and King Rehoboam made in their place shields of bronze and committed them to the hands of the officers of the guard who kept the door of the king s house
And as often as the king went into the house of the LORD the guard carried them and brought them back to the guardroom
Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam and all that he did are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah
And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually
And Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David His mother s name was Naamah the Ammonite And Abijam his son reigned in his place
