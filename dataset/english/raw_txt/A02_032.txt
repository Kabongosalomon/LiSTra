Exodus 32
When the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain the people gathered themselves together to Aaron and said to him Up make us gods who shall go before us As for this Moses the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt we do not know what has become of him
So Aaron said to them Take off the rings of gold that are in the ears of your wives your sons and your daughters and bring them to me
So all the people took off the rings of gold that were in their ears and brought them to Aaron
And he received the gold from their hand and fashioned it with a graving tool and made a golden calf And they said These are your gods O Israel who brought you up out of the land of Egypt
When Aaron saw this he built an altar before it And Aaron made proclamation and said Tomorrow shall be a feast to the LORD
And they rose up early the next day and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings And the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play
And the LORD said to Moses Go down for your people whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt have corrupted themselves
They have turned aside quickly out of the way that I commanded them They have made for themselves a golden calf and have worshiped it and sacrificed to it and said These are your gods O Israel who brought you up out of the land of Egypt
And the LORD said to Moses I have seen this people and behold it is a stiff necked people
Now therefore let me alone that my wrath may burn hot against them and I may consume them in order that I may make a great nation of you
But Moses implored the LORD his God and said O LORD why does your wrath burn hot against your people whom you have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand
Why should the Egyptians say With evil intent did he bring them out to kill them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth Turn from your burning anger and relent from this disaster against your people
Remember Abraham Isaac and Israel your servants to whom you swore by your own self and said to them I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and all this land that I have promised I will give to your offspring and they shall inherit it forever
And the LORD relented from the disaster that he had spoken of bringing on his people
Then Moses turned and went down from the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand tablets that were written on both sides on the front and on the back they were written
The tablets were the work of God and the writing was the writing of God engraved on the tablets
When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted he said to Moses There is a noise of war in the camp
But he said It is not the sound of shouting for victory or the sound of the cry of defeat but the sound of singing that I hear
And as soon as he came near the camp and saw the calf and the dancing Moses anger burned hot and he threw the tablets out of his hands and broke them at the foot of the mountain
He took the calf that they had made and burned it with fire and ground it to powder and scattered it on the water and made the people of Israel drink it
And Moses said to Aaron What did this people do to you that you have brought such a great sin upon them
And Aaron said Let not the anger of my lord burn hot You know the people that they are set on evil
For they said to me Make us gods who shall go before us As for this Moses the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt we do not know what has become of him
So I said to them Let any who have gold take it off So they gave it to me and I threw it into the fire and out came this calf
And when Moses saw that the people had broken loose for Aaron had let them break loose to the derision of their enemies
then Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said Who is on the LORD s side Come to me And all the sons of Levi gathered around him
And he said to them Thus says the LORD God of Israel Put your sword on your side each of you and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp and each of you kill his brother and his companion and his neighbor
And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses And that day about three thousand men of the people fell
And Moses said Today you have been ordained for the service of the LORD each one at the cost of his son and of his brother so that he might bestow a blessing upon you this day
The next day Moses said to the people You have sinned a great sin And now I will go up to the LORD perhaps I can make atonement for your sin
So Moses returned to the LORD and said Alas this people has sinned a great sin They have made for themselves gods of gold
But now if you will forgive their sin but if not please blot me out of your book that you have written
But the LORD said to Moses Whoever has sinned against me I will blot out of my book
But now go lead the people to the place about which I have spoken to you behold my angel shall go before you Nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them
Then the LORD sent a plague on the people because they made the calf the one that Aaron made
