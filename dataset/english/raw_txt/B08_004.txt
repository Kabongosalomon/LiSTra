2 Corienthians 4
Therefore having this ministry by the mercy of God we do not lose heart
But we have renounced disgraceful underhanded ways We refuse to practice cunning or to tamper with God s word but by the open statement of the truth we would commend ourselves to everyone s conscience in the sight of God
And even if our gospel is veiled it is veiled only to those who are perishing
In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ who is the image of God
For what we proclaim is not ourselves but Jesus Christ as Lord with ourselves as your servants for Jesus sake
For God who said Let light shine out of darkness has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ
But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us
We are afflicted in every way but not crushed perplexed but not driven to despair
persecuted but not forsaken struck down but not destroyed
always carrying in the body the death of Jesus so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies
For we who live are always being given over to death for Jesus sake so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh
So death is at work in us but life in you
Since we have the same spirit of faith according to what has been written I believed and so I spoke we also believe and so we also speak
knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence
For it is all for your sake so that as grace extends to more and more people it may increase thanksgiving to the glory of God
So we do not lose heart Though our outer self is wasting away our inner self is being renewed day by day
For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison
as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen For the things that are seen are transient but the things that are unseen are eternal
