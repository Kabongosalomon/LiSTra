2 Chronicles 9
Now when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions having a very great retinue and camels bearing spices and very much gold and precious stones And when she came to Solomon she told him all that was on her mind
And Solomon answered all her questions There was nothing hidden from Solomon that he could not explain to her
And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon the house that he had built
the food of his table the seating of his officials and the attendance of his servants and their clothing his cupbearers and their clothing and his burnt offerings that he offered at the house of the LORD there was no more breath in her
And she said to the king The report was true that I heard in my own land of your words and of your wisdom
but I did not believe the reports until I came and my own eyes had seen it And behold half the greatness of your wisdom was not told me you surpass the report that I heard
Happy are your wives Happy are these your servants who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom
Blessed be the LORD your God who has delighted in you and set you on his throne as king for the LORD your God Because your God loved Israel and would establish them forever he has made you king over them that you may execute justice and righteousness
Then she gave the king talents of gold and a very great quantity of spices and precious stones There were no spices such as those that the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon
Moreover the servants of Hiram and the servants of Solomon who brought gold from Ophir brought algum wood and precious stones
And the king made from the algum wood supports for the house of the LORD and for the king s house lyres also and harps for the singers There never was seen the like of them before in the land of Judah
And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all that she desired whatever she asked besides what she had brought to the king So she turned and went back to her own land with her servants
Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was talents of gold
besides that which the explorers and merchants brought And all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the land brought gold and silver to Solomon
King Solomon made large shields of beaten gold shekels of beaten gold went into each shield
And he made shields of beaten gold shekels of gold went into each shield and the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon
The king also made a great ivory throne and overlaid it with pure gold
The throne had six steps and a footstool of gold which were attached to the throne and on each side of the seat were armrests and two lions standing beside the armrests
while twelve lions stood there one on each end of a step on the six steps Nothing like it was ever made for any kingdom
All King Solomon s drinking vessels were of gold and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold Silver was not considered as anything in the days of Solomon
For the king s ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Hiram Once every three years the ships of Tarshish used to come bringing gold silver ivory apes and peacocks
Thus King Solomon excelled all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom
And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom which God had put into his mind
Every one of them brought his present articles of silver and of gold garments myrrh spices horses and mules so much year by year
And Solomon had stalls for horses and chariots and horsemen whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem
And he ruled over all the kings from the Euphrates to the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt
And the king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stone and he made cedar as plentiful as the sycamore of the Shephelah
And horses were imported for Solomon from Egypt and from all lands
Now the rest of the acts of Solomon from first to last are they not written in the history of Nathan the prophet and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat
Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years
And Solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David his father and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place
