Hosea 12
Ephraim feeds on the wind and pursues the east wind all day long they multiply falsehood and violence they make a covenant with Assyria and oil is carried to Egypt
The LORD has an indictment against Judah and will punish Jacob according to his ways he will repay him according to his deeds
In the womb he took his brother by the heel and in his manhood he strove with God
He strove with the angel and prevailed he wept and sought his favor He met God at Bethel and there God spoke with us
the LORD the God of hosts the LORD is his memorial name
So you by the help of your God return hold fast to love and justice and wait continually for your God
A merchant in whose hands are false balances he loves to oppress
Ephraim has said Ah but I am rich I have found wealth for myself in all my labors they cannot find in me iniquity or sin
I am the LORD your God from the land of Egypt I will again make you dwell in tents as in the days of the appointed feast
I spoke to the prophets it was I who multiplied visions and through the prophets gave parables
If there is iniquity in Gilead they shall surely come to nothing in Gilgal they sacrifice bulls their altars also are like stone heaps on the furrows of the field
Jacob fled to the land of Aram there Israel served for a wife and for a wife he guarded sheep
By a prophet the LORD brought Israel up from Egypt and by a prophet he was guarded
Ephraim has given bitter provocation so his Lord will leave his bloodguilt on him and will repay him for his disgraceful deeds
