Ephesians 5
Therefore be imitators of God as beloved children
And walk in love as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God
But sexual immorality and all impurity or covetousness must not even be named among you as is proper among saints
Let there be no filthiness nor foolish talk nor crude joking which are out of place but instead let there be thanksgiving
For you may be sure of this that everyone who is sexually immoral or impure or who is covetous that is an idolater has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God
Let no one deceive you with empty words for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience
Therefore do not become partners with them
for at one time you were darkness but now you are light in the Lord Walk as children of light
for the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true
and try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord
Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness but instead expose them
For it is shameful even to speak of the things that they do in secret
But when anything is exposed by the light it becomes visible
for anything that becomes visible is light Therefore it says Awake O sleeper and arise from the dead and Christ will shine on you
Look carefully then how you walk not as unwise but as wise
making the best use of the time because the days are evil
Therefore do not be foolish but understand what the will of the Lord is
And do not get drunk with wine for that is debauchery but be filled with the Spirit
addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody to the Lord with your heart
giving thanks always and for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ
Wives submit to your own husbands as to the Lord
For the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church his body and is himself its Savior
Now as the church submits to Christ so also wives should submit in everything to their husbands
Husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her
that he might sanctify her having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word
so that he might present the church to himself in splendor without spot or wrinkle or any such thing that she might be holy and without blemish
In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies He who loves his wife loves himself
For no one ever hated his own flesh but nourishes and cherishes it just as Christ does the church
because we are members of his body
Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife and the two shall become one flesh
This mystery is profound and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church
However let each one of you love his wife as himself and let the wife see that she respects her husband
