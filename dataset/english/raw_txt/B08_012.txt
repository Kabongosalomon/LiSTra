2 Corienthians 12
I must go on boasting Though there is nothing to be gained by it I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord
I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven whether in the body or out of the body I do not know God knows
And I know that this man was caught up into paradise whether in the body or out of the body I do not know God knows
and he heard things that cannot be told which man may not utter
On behalf of this man I will boast but on my own behalf I will not boast except of my weaknesses
Though if I should wish to boast I would not be a fool for I would be speaking the truth But I refrain from it so that no one may think more of me than he sees in me or hears from me
So to keep me from becoming conceited because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations a thorn was given me in the flesh a messenger of Satan to harass me to keep me from becoming conceited
Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this that it should leave me
But he said to me My grace is sufficient for you for my power is made perfect in weakness Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses so that the power of Christ may rest upon me
For the sake of Christ then I am content with weaknesses insults hardships persecutions and calamities For when I am weak then I am strong
I have been a fool You forced me to it for I ought to have been commended by you For I was not at all inferior to these super apostles even though I am nothing
The signs of a true apostle were performed among you with utmost patience with signs and wonders and mighty works
For in what were you less favored than the rest of the churches except that I myself did not burden you Forgive me this wrong
Here for the third time I am ready to come to you And I will not be a burden for I seek not what is yours but you For children are not obligated to save up for their parents but parents for their children
I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls If I love you more am I to be loved less
But granting that I myself did not burden you I was crafty you say and got the better of you by deceit
Did I take advantage of you through any of those whom I sent to you
I urged Titus to go and sent the brother with him Did Titus take advantage of you Did we not act in the same spirit Did we not take the same steps
Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you It is in the sight of God that we have been speaking in Christ and all for your upbuilding beloved
For I fear that perhaps when I come I may find you not as I wish and that you may find me not as you wish that perhaps there may be quarreling jealousy anger hostility slander gossip conceit and disorder
I fear that when I come again my God may humble me before you and I may have to mourn over many of those who sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity sexual immorality and sensuality that they have practiced
