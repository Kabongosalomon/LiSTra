2 Kings 21
Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign and he reigned fifty five years in Jerusalem His mother s name was Hephzibah
And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD according to the despicable practices of the nations whom the LORD drove out before the people of Israel
For he rebuilt the high places that Hezekiah his father had destroyed and he erected altars for Baal and made an Asherah as Ahab king of Israel had done and worshiped all the host of heaven and served them
And he built altars in the house of the LORD of which the LORD had said In Jerusalem will I put my name
And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD
And he burned his son as an offering and used fortune telling and omens and dealt with mediums and with necromancers He did much evil in the sight of the LORD provoking him to anger
And the carved image of Asherah that he had made he set in the house of which the LORD said to David and to Solomon his son In this house and in Jerusalem which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel I will put my name forever
And I will not cause the feet of Israel to wander anymore out of the land that I gave to their fathers if only they will be careful to do according to all that I have commanded them and according to all the Law that my servant Moses commanded them
But they did not listen and Manasseh led them astray to do more evil than the nations had done whom the LORD destroyed before the people of Israel
And the LORD said by his servants the prophets
Because Manasseh king of Judah has committed these abominations and has done things more evil than all that the Amorites did who were before him and has made Judah also to sin with his idols
therefore thus says the LORD the God of Israel Behold I am bringing upon Jerusalem and Judah such disaster that the ears of everyone who hears of it will tingle
And I will stretch over Jerusalem the measuring line of Samaria and the plumb line of the house of Ahab and I will wipe Jerusalem as one wipes a dish wiping it and turning it upside down
And I will forsake the remnant of my heritage and give them into the hand of their enemies and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies
because they have done what is evil in my sight and have provoked me to anger since the day their fathers came out of Egypt even to this day
Moreover Manasseh shed very much innocent blood till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another besides the sin that he made Judah to sin so that they did what was evil in the sight of the LORD
Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh and all that he did and the sin that he committed are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah
And Manasseh slept with his fathers and was buried in the garden of his house in the garden of Uzza and Amon his son reigned in his place
Amon was twenty two years old when he began to reign and he reigned two years in Jerusalem His mother s name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah
And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD as Manasseh his father had done
He walked in all the way in which his father walked and served the idols that his father served and worshiped them
He abandoned the LORD the God of his fathers and did not walk in the way of the LORD
And the servants of Amon conspired against him and put the king to death in his house
But the people of the land struck down all those who had conspired against King Amon and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place
Now the rest of the acts of Amon that he did are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah
And he was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza and Josiah his son reigned in his place
