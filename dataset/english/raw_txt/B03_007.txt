Luke 7
After he had finished all his sayings in the hearing of the people he entered Capernaum
Now a centurion had a servant who was sick and at the point of death who was highly valued by him
When the centurion heard about Jesus he sent to him elders of the Jews asking him to come and heal his servant
And when they came to Jesus they pleaded with him earnestly saying He is worthy to have you do this for him
for he loves our nation and he is the one who built us our synagogue
And Jesus went with them When he was not far from the house the centurion sent friends saying to him Lord do not trouble yourself for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof
Therefore I did not presume to come to you But say the word and let my servant be healed
For I too am a man set under authority with soldiers under me and I say to one Go and he goes and to another Come and he comes and to my servant Do this and he does it
When Jesus heard these things he marveled at him and turning to the crowd that followed him said I tell you not even in Israel have I found such faith
And when those who had been sent returned to the house they found the servant well
Soon afterward he went to a town called Nain and his disciples and a great crowd went with him
As he drew near to the gate of the town behold a man who had died was being carried out the only son of his mother and she was a widow and a considerable crowd from the town was with her
And when the Lord saw her he had compassion on her and said to her Do not weep
Then he came up and touched the bier and the bearers stood still And he said Young man I say to you arise
And the dead man sat up and began to speak and Jesus gave him to his mother
Fear seized them all and they glorified God saying A great prophet has arisen among us and God has visited his people
And this report about him spread through the whole of Judea and all the surrounding country
The disciples of John reported all these things to him And John
calling two of his disciples to him sent them to the Lord saying Are you the one who is to come or shall we look for another
And when the men had come to him they said John the Baptist has sent us to you saying Are you the one who is to come or shall we look for another
In that hour he healed many people of diseases and plagues and evil spirits and on many who were blind he bestowed sight
And he answered them Go and tell John what you have seen and heard the blind receive their sight the lame walk lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear the dead are raised up the poor have good news preached to them
And blessed is the one who is not offended by me
When John s messengers had gone Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John What did you go out into the wilderness to see A reed shaken by the wind
What then did you go out to see A man dressed in soft clothing Behold those who are dressed in splendid clothing and live in luxury are in kings courts
What then did you go out to see A prophet Yes I tell you and more than a prophet
This is he of whom it is written Behold I send my messenger before your face who will prepare your way before you
I tell you among those born of women none is greater than John Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he
When all the people heard this and the tax collectors too they declared God just having been baptized with the baptism of John
but the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the purpose of God for themselves not having been baptized by him
To what then shall I compare the people of this generation and what are they like
They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another We played the flute for you and you did not dance we sang a dirge and you did not weep
For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine and you say He has a demon
The Son of Man has come eating and drinking and you say Look at him A glutton and a drunkard a friend of tax collectors and sinners
Yet wisdom is justified by all her children
One of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him and he went into the Pharisee s house and took his place at the table
And behold a woman of the city who was a sinner when she learned that he was reclining at table in the Pharisee s house brought an alabaster flask of ointment
and standing behind him at his feet weeping she began to wet his feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment
Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this he said to himself If this man were a prophet he would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him for she is a sinner
And Jesus answering said to him Simon I have something to say to you And he answered Say it Teacher
A certain moneylender had two debtors One owed five hundred denarii and the other fifty
When they could not pay he cancelled the debt of both Now which of them will love him more
Simon answered The one I suppose for whom he cancelled the larger debt And he said to him You have judged rightly
Then turning toward the woman he said to Simon Do you see this woman I entered your house you gave me no water for my feet but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair
You gave me no kiss but from the time I came in she has not ceased to kiss my feet
You did not anoint my head with oil but she has anointed my feet with ointment
Therefore I tell you her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much But he who is forgiven little loves little
And he said to her Your sins are forgiven
Then those who were at table with him began to say among themselves Who is this who even forgives sins
And he said to the woman Your faith has saved you go in peace
