Isaiah 23
The oracle concerning Tyre Wail O ships of Tarshish for Tyre is laid waste without house or harbor From the land of Cyprus it is revealed to them
Be still O inhabitants of the coast the merchants of Sidon who cross the sea have filled you
And on many waters your revenue was the grain of Shihor the harvest of the Nile you were the merchant of the nations
Be ashamed O Sidon for the sea has spoken the stronghold of the sea saying I have neither labored nor given birth I have neither reared young men nor brought up young women
When the report comes to Egypt they will be in anguish over the report about Tyre
Cross over to Tarshish wail O inhabitants of the coast
Is this your exultant city whose origin is from days of old whose feet carried her to settle far away
Who has purposed this against Tyre the bestower of crowns whose merchants were princes whose traders were the honored of the earth
The LORD of hosts has purposed it to defile the pompous pride of all glory to dishonor all the honored of the earth
Cross over your land like the Nile O daughter of Tarshish there is no restraint anymore
He has stretched out his hand over the sea he has shaken the kingdoms the LORD has given command concerning Canaan to destroy its strongholds
And he said You will no more exult O oppressed virgin daughter of Sidon arise cross over to Cyprus even there you will have no rest
Behold the land of the Chaldeans This is the people that was not Assyria destined it for wild beasts They erected their siege towers they stripped her palaces bare they made her a ruin
Wail O ships of Tarshish for your stronghold is laid waste
In that day Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years like the days of one king At the end of seventy years it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the prostitute
Take a harp go about the city O forgotten prostitute Make sweet melody sing many songs that you may be remembered
At the end of seventy years the LORD will visit Tyre and she will return to her wages and will prostitute herself with all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth
Her merchandise and her wages will be holy to the LORD It will not be stored or hoarded but her merchandise will supply abundant food and fine clothing for those who dwell before the LORD
