Israel said to Joseph Now let me die since I have seen your face and know that you are still alive
Joseph said to his brothers and to his father s household I will go up and tell Pharaoh and will say to him My brothers and my father s household who were in the land of Canaan have come to me
And the men are shepherds for they have been keepers of livestock and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have
When Pharaoh calls you and says What is your occupation
you shall say Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now both we and our fathers in order that you may dwell in the land of Goshen for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians
