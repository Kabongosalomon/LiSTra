Genesis 18
And the LORD appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre as he sat at the door of his tent in the heat of the day
He lifted up his eyes and looked and behold three men were standing in front of him When he saw them he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed himself to the earth
and said O Lord if I have found favor in your sight do not pass by your servant
Let a little water be brought and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree
while I bring a morsel of bread that you may refresh yourselves and after that you may pass on since you have come to your servant So they said Do as you have said
And Abraham went quickly into the tent to Sarah and said Quick Three seahs of fine flour Knead it and make cakes
And Abraham ran to the herd and took a calf tender and good and gave it to a young man who prepared it quickly
Then he took curds and milk and the calf that he had prepared and set it before them And he stood by them under the tree while they ate
They said to him Where is Sarah your wife And he said She is in the tent
The LORD said I will surely return to you about this time next year and Sarah your wife shall have a son And Sarah was listening at the tent door behind him
Now Abraham and Sarah were old advanced in years The way of women had ceased to be with Sarah
So Sarah laughed to herself saying After I am worn out and my lord is old shall I have pleasure
The LORD said to Abraham Why did Sarah laugh and say Shall I indeed bear a child now that I am old
Is anything too hard for the LORD At the appointed time I will return to you about this time next year and Sarah shall have a son
But Sarah denied it saying I did not laugh for she was afraid He said No but you did laugh
Then the men set out from there and they looked down toward Sodom And Abraham went with them to set them on their way
The LORD said Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do
seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him
For I have chosen him that he may command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing righteousness and justice so that the LORD may bring to Abraham what he has promised him
Then the LORD said Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great and their sin is very grave
I will go down to see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry that has come to me And if not I will know
So the men turned from there and went toward Sodom but Abraham still stood before the LORD
Then Abraham drew near and said Will you indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked
Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city Will you then sweep away the place and not spare it for the fifty righteous who are in it
Far be it from you to do such a thing to put the righteous to death with the wicked so that the righteous fare as the wicked Far be that from you Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just
And the LORD said If I find at Sodom fifty righteous in the city I will spare the whole place for their sake
Abraham answered and said Behold I have undertaken to speak to the Lord I who am but dust and ashes
Suppose five of the fifty righteous are lacking Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five And he said I will not destroy it if I find forty five there
Again he spoke to him and said Suppose forty are found there He answered For the sake of forty I will not do it
Then he said Oh let not the Lord be angry and I will speak Suppose thirty are found there He answered I will not do it if I find thirty there
He said Behold I have undertaken to speak to the Lord Suppose twenty are found there He answered For the sake of twenty I will not destroy it
Then he said Oh let not the Lord be angry and I will speak again but this once Suppose ten are found there He answered For the sake of ten I will not destroy it
And the LORD went his way when he had finished speaking to Abraham and Abraham returned to his place
