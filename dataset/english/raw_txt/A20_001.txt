Proverbs 1
The proverbs of Solomon son of David king of Israel
To know wisdom and instruction to understand words of insight
to receive instruction in wise dealing in righteousness justice and equity
to give prudence to the simple knowledge and discretion to the youth
Let the wise hear and increase in learning and the one who understands obtain guidance
to understand a proverb and a saying the words of the wise and their riddles
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge fools despise wisdom and instruction
Hear my son your father s instruction and forsake not your mother s teaching
for they are a graceful garland for your head and pendants for your neck
My son if sinners entice you do not consent
If they say Come with us let us lie in wait for blood let us ambush the innocent without reason
like Sheol let us swallow them alive and whole like those who go down to the pit
we shall find all precious goods we shall fill our houses with plunder
throw in your lot among us we will all have one purse
my son do not walk in the way with them hold back your foot from their paths
for their feet run to evil and they make haste to shed blood
For in vain is a net spread in the sight of any bird
but these men lie in wait for their own blood they set an ambush for their own lives
Such are the ways of everyone who is greedy for unjust gain it takes away the life of its possessors
Wisdom cries aloud in the street in the markets she raises her voice
at the head of the noisy streets she cries out at the entrance of the city gates she speaks
How long O simple ones will you love being simple How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing and fools hate knowledge
If you turn at my reproof behold I will pour out my spirit to you I will make my words known to you
Because I have called and you refused to listen have stretched out my hand and no one has heeded
because you have ignored all my counsel and would have none of my reproof
I also will laugh at your calamity I will mock when terror strikes you
when terror strikes you like a storm and your calamity comes like a whirlwind when distress and anguish come upon you
Then they will call upon me but I will not answer they will seek me diligently but will not find me
Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the LORD
would have none of my counsel and despised all my reproof
therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way and have their fill of their own devices
For the simple are killed by their turning away and the complacency of fools destroys them
but whoever listens to me will dwell secure and will be at ease without dread of disaster
