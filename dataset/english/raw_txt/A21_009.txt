Ecclesiastes 9
But all this I laid to heart examining it all how the righteous and the wise and their deeds are in the hand of God Whether it is love or hate man does not know both are before him
It is the same for all since the same event happens to the righteous and the wicked to the good and the evil to the clean and the unclean to him who sacrifices and him who does not sacrifice As the good one is so is the sinner and he who swears is as he who shuns an oath
This is an evil in all that is done under the sun that the same event happens to all Also the hearts of the children of man are full of evil and madness is in their hearts while they live and after that they go to the dead
But he who is joined with all the living has hope for a living dog is better than a dead lion
For the living know that they will die but the dead know nothing and they have no more reward for the memory of them is forgotten
Their love and their hate and their envy have already perished and forever they have no more share in all that is done under the sun
Go eat your bread with joy and drink your wine with a merry heart for God has already approved what you do
Let your garments be always white Let not oil be lacking on your head
Enjoy life with the wife whom you love all the days of your vain life that he has given you under the sun because that is your portion in life and in your toil at which you toil under the sun
Whatever your hand finds to do do it with your might for there is no work or thought or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol to which you are going
Again I saw that under the sun the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong nor bread to the wise nor riches to the intelligent nor favor to those with knowledge but time and chance happen to them all
For man does not know his time Like fish that are taken in an evil net and like birds that are caught in a snare so the children of man are snared at an evil time when it suddenly falls upon them
I have also seen this example of wisdom under the sun and it seemed great to me
There was a little city with few men in it and a great king came against it and besieged it building great siegeworks against it
But there was found in it a poor wise man and he by his wisdom delivered the city Yet no one remembered that poor man
But I say that wisdom is better than might though the poor man s wisdom is despised and his words are not heard
The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the shouting of a ruler among fools
Wisdom is better than weapons of war but one sinner destroys much good
