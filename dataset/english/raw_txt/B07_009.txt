1 Corienthians 9
Am I not free Am I not an apostle Have I not seen Jesus our Lord Are not you my workmanship in the Lord
If to others I am not an apostle at least I am to you for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord
This is my defense to those who would examine me
Do we not have the right to eat and drink
Do we not have the right to take along a believing wife as do the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas
Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from working for a living
Who serves as a soldier at his own expense Who plants a vineyard without eating any of its fruit Or who tends a flock without getting some of the milk
Do I say these things on human authority Does not the Law say the same
For it is written in the Law of Moses You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain Is it for oxen that God is concerned
Does he not speak entirely for our sake It was written for our sake because the plowman should plow in hope and the thresher thresh in hope of sharing in the crop
If we have sown spiritual things among you is it too much if we reap material things from you
If others share this rightful claim on you do not we even more Nevertheless we have not made use of this right but we endure anything rather than put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ
Do you not know that those who are employed in the temple service get their food from the temple and those who serve at the altar share in the sacrificial offerings
In the same way the Lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel
But I have made no use of any of these rights nor am I writing these things to secure any such provision For I would rather die than have anyone deprive me of my ground for boasting
For if I preach the gospel that gives me no ground for boasting For necessity is laid upon me Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel
For if I do this of my own will I have a reward but if not of my own will I am still entrusted with a stewardship
What then is my reward That in my preaching I may present the gospel free of charge so as not to make full use of my right in the gospel
For though I am free from all I have made myself a servant to all that I might win more of them
To the Jews I became as a Jew in order to win Jews To those under the law I became as one under the law though not being myself under the law that I might win those under the law
To those outside the law I became as one outside the law not being outside the law of God but under the law of Christ that I might win those outside the law
To the weak I became weak that I might win the weak I have become all things to all people that by all means I might save some
I do it all for the sake of the gospel that I may share with them in its blessings
Do you not know that in a race all the runners run but only one receives the prize So run that you may obtain it
Every athlete exercises self control in all things They do it to receive a perishable wreath but we an imperishable
So I do not run aimlessly I do not box as one beating the air
But I discipline my body and keep it under control lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified
