Isaiah 37
As soon as King Hezekiah heard it he tore his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the LORD
And he sent Eliakim who was over the household and Shebna the secretary and the senior priests covered with sackcloth to the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz
They said to him Thus says Hezekiah This day is a day of distress of rebuke and of disgrace children have come to the point of birth and there is no strength to bring them forth
It may be that the LORD your God will hear the words of the Rabshakeh whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to mock the living God and will rebuke the words that the LORD your God has heard therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left
When the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah
Isaiah said to them Say to your master Thus says the LORD Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard with which the young men of the king of Assyria have reviled me
Behold I will put a spirit in him so that he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land and I will make him fall by the sword in his own land
The Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah for he had heard that the king had left Lachish
Now the king heard concerning Tirhakah king of Cush He has set out to fight against you And when he heard it he sent messengers to Hezekiah saying
Thus shall you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you by promising that Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria
Behold you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands devoting them to destruction And shall you be delivered
Have the gods of the nations delivered them the nations that my fathers destroyed Gozan Haran Rezeph and the people of Eden who were in Telassar
Where is the king of Hamath the king of Arpad the king of the city of Sepharvaim the king of Hena or the king of Ivvah
Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it and Hezekiah went up to the house of the LORD and spread it before the LORD
And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD
O LORD of hosts God of Israel enthroned above the cherubim you are the God you alone of all the kingdoms of the earth you have made heaven and earth
Incline your ear O LORD and hear open your eyes O LORD and see and hear all the words of Sennacherib which he has sent to mock the living God
Truly O LORD the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their lands
and have cast their gods into the fire For they were no gods but the work of men s hands wood and stone Therefore they were destroyed
So now O LORD our God save us from his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone are the LORD
Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah saying Thus says the LORD the God of Israel Because you have prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria
this is the word that the LORD has spoken concerning him She despises you she scorns you the virgin daughter of Zion she wags her head behind you the daughter of Jerusalem
Whom have you mocked and reviled Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes to the heights Against the Holy One of Israel
By your servants you have mocked the Lord and you have said With my many chariots I have gone up the heights of the mountains to the far recesses of Lebanon to cut down its tallest cedars its choicest cypresses to come to its remotest height its most fruitful forest
I dug wells and drank waters to dry up with the sole of my foot all the streams of Egypt
Have you not heard that I determined it long ago I planned from days of old what now I bring to pass that you should make fortified cities crash into heaps of ruins
while their inhabitants shorn of strength are dismayed and confounded and have become like plants of the field and like tender grass like grass on the housetops blighted before it is grown
I know your sitting down and your going out and coming in and your raging against me
Because you have raged against me and your complacency has come to my ears I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth and I will turn you back on the way by which you came
And this shall be the sign for you this year you shall eat what grows of itself and in the second year what springs from that Then in the third year sow and reap and plant vineyards and eat their fruit
And the surviving remnant of the house of Judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward
For out of Jerusalem shall go a remnant and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this
Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the king of Assyria He shall not come into this city or shoot an arrow there or come before it with a shield or cast up a siege mound against it
By the way that he came by the same he shall return and he shall not come into this city declares the LORD
For I will defend this city to save it for my own sake and for the sake of my servant David
And the angel of the LORD went out and struck down a hundred and eighty five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians And when people arose early in the morning behold these were all dead bodies
Then Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and returned home and lived at Nineveh
And as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons struck him down with the sword And after they escaped into the land of Ararat Esarhaddon his son reigned in his place
