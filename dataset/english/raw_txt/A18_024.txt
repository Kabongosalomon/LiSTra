Job 24
Why are not times of judgment kept by the Almighty and why do those who know him never see his days
Some move landmarks they seize flocks and pasture them
They drive away the donkey of the fatherless they take the widow s ox for a pledge
They thrust the poor off the road the poor of the earth all hide themselves
Behold like wild donkeys in the desert the poor go out to their toil seeking game the wasteland yields food for their children
They gather their fodder in the field and they glean the vineyard of the wicked man
They lie all night naked without clothing and have no covering in the cold
They are wet with the rain of the mountains and cling to the rock for lack of shelter
There are those who snatch the fatherless child from the breast and they take a pledge against the poor
They go about naked without clothing hungry they carry the sheaves
among the olive rows of the wicked they make oil they tread the winepresses but suffer thirst
From out of the city the dying groan and the soul of the wounded cries for help yet God charges no one with wrong
There are those who rebel against the light who are not acquainted with its ways and do not stay in its paths
The murderer rises before it is light that he may kill the poor and needy and in the night he is like a thief
The eye of the adulterer also waits for the twilight saying No eye will see me and he veils his face
In the dark they dig through houses by day they shut themselves up they do not know the light
For deep darkness is morning to all of them for they are friends with the terrors of deep darkness
You say Swift are they on the face of the waters their portion is cursed in the land no treader turns toward their vineyards
Drought and heat snatch away the snow waters so does Sheol those who have sinned
The womb forgets them the worm finds them sweet they are no longer remembered so wickedness is broken like a tree
They wrong the barren childless woman and do no good to the widow
Yet God prolongs the life of the mighty by his power they rise up when they despair of life
He gives them security and they are supported and his eyes are upon their ways
They are exalted a little while and then are gone they are brought low and gathered up like all others they are cut off like the heads of grain
If it is not so who will prove me a liar and show that there is nothing in what I say
