Mark 15
And as soon as it was morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole Council And they bound Jesus and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate
And Pilate asked him Are you the King of the Jews And he answered him You have said so
And the chief priests accused him of many things
And Pilate again asked him Have you no answer to make See how many charges they bring against you
But Jesus made no further answer so that Pilate was amazed
Now at the feast he used to release for them one prisoner for whom they asked
And among the rebels in prison who had committed murder in the insurrection there was a man called Barabbas
And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he usually did for them
And he answered them saying Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews
For he perceived that it was out of envy that the chief priests had delivered him up
But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barabbas instead
And Pilate again said to them Then what shall I do with the man you call the King of the Jews
And they cried out again Crucify him
And Pilate said to them Why what evil has he done But they shouted all the more Crucify him
So Pilate wishing to satisfy the crowd released for them Barabbas and having scourged Jesus he delivered him to be crucified
And the soldiers led him away inside the palace that is the governor s headquarters and they called together the whole battalion
And they clothed him in a purple cloak and twisting together a crown of thorns they put it on him
And they began to salute him Hail King of the Jews
And they were striking his head with a reed and spitting on him and kneeling down in homage to him
And when they had mocked him they stripped him of the purple cloak and put his own clothes on him And they led him out to crucify him
And they compelled a passerby Simon of Cyrene who was coming in from the country the father of Alexander and Rufus to carry his cross
And they brought him to the place called Golgotha which means Place of a Skull
And they offered him wine mixed with myrrh but he did not take it
And they crucified him and divided his garments among them casting lots for them to decide what each should take
And it was the third hour when they crucified him
And the inscription of the charge against him read The King of the Jews
And with him they crucified two robbers one on his right and one on his left
And those who passed by derided him wagging their heads and saying Aha You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days
save yourself and come down from the cross
So also the chief priests with the scribes mocked him to one another saying He saved others he cannot save himself
Let the Christ the King of Israel come down now from the cross that we may see and believe Those who were crucified with him also reviled him
And when the sixth hour had come there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour
And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice Eloi Eloi lema sabachthani which means My God my God why have you forsaken me
And some of the bystanders hearing it said Behold he is calling Elijah
And someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink saying Wait let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down
And Jesus uttered a loud cry and breathed his last
And the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom
And when the centurion who stood facing him saw that in this way he breathed his last he said Truly this man was the Son of God
There were also women looking on from a distance among whom were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses and Salome
When he was in Galilee they followed him and ministered to him and there were also many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem
And when evening had come since it was the day of Preparation that is the day before the Sabbath
Joseph of Arimathea a respected member of the Council who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God took courage and went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus
Pilate was surprised to hear that he should have already died And summoning the centurion he asked him whether he was already dead
And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead he granted the corpse to Joseph
And Joseph bought a linen shroud and taking him down wrapped him in the linen shroud and laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock And he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb
Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid
