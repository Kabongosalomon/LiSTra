Genesis 12
Now the LORD said to Abram Go from your country and your kindred and your father s house to the land that I will show you
And I will make of you a great nation and I will bless you and make your name great so that you will be a blessing
I will bless those who bless you and him who dishonors you I will curse and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed
So Abram went as the LORD had told him and Lot went with him Abram was seventy five years old when he departed from Haran
And Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot his brother s son and all their possessions that they had gathered and the people that they had acquired in Haran and they set out to go to the land of Canaan When they came to the land of Canaan
Abram passed through the land to the place at Shechem to the oak of Moreh At that time the Canaanites were in the land
Then the LORD appeared to Abram and said To your offspring I will give this land So he built there an altar to the LORD who had appeared to him
From there he moved to the hill country on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east And there he built an altar to the LORD and called upon the name of the LORD
And Abram journeyed on still going toward the Negeb
Now there was a famine in the land So Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there for the famine was severe in the land
When he was about to enter Egypt he said to Sarai his wife I know that you are a woman beautiful in appearance
and when the Egyptians see you they will say This is his wife Then they will kill me but they will let you live
Say you are my sister that it may go well with me because of you and that my life may be spared for your sake
When Abram entered Egypt the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful
And when the princes of Pharaoh saw her they praised her to Pharaoh And the woman was taken into Pharaoh s house
And for her sake he dealt well with Abram and he had sheep oxen male donkeys male servants female servants female donkeys and camels
But the LORD afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram s wife
So Pharaoh called Abram and said What is this you have done to me Why did you not tell me that she was your wife
Why did you say She is my sister so that I took her for my wife Now then here is your wife take her and go
And Pharaoh gave men orders concerning him and they sent him away with his wife and all that he had
