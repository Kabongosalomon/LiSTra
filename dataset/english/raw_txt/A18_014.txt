Job 14
Man who is born of a woman is few of days and full of trouble
He comes out like a flower and withers he flees like a shadow and continues not
And do you open your eyes on such a one and bring me into judgment with you
Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean There is not one
Since his days are determined and the number of his months is with you and you have appointed his limits that he cannot pass
look away from him and leave him alone that he may enjoy like a hired hand his day
For there is hope for a tree if it be cut down that it will sprout again and that its shoots will not cease
Though its root grow old in the earth and its stump die in the soil
yet at the scent of water it will bud and put out branches like a young plant
But a man dies and is laid low man breathes his last and where is he
As waters fail from a lake and a river wastes away and dries up
so a man lies down and rises not again till the heavens are no more he will not awake or be roused out of his sleep
Oh that you would hide me in Sheol that you would conceal me until your wrath be past that you would appoint me a set time and remember me
If a man dies shall he live again All the days of my service I would wait till my renewal should come
You would call and I would answer you you would long for the work of your hands
For then you would number my steps you would not keep watch over my sin
my transgression would be sealed up in a bag and you would cover over my iniquity
But the mountain falls and crumbles away and the rock is removed from its place
the waters wear away the stones the torrents wash away the soil of the earth so you destroy the hope of man
You prevail forever against him and he passes you change his countenance and send him away
His sons come to honor and he does not know it they are brought low and he perceives it not
He feels only the pain of his own body and he mourns only for himself
