Colossians 3
If then you have been raised with Christ seek the things that are above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God
Set your minds on things that are above not on things that are on earth
For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God
When Christ who is your life appears then you also will appear with him in glory
Put to death therefore what is earthly in you sexual immorality impurity passion evil desire and covetousness which is idolatry
On account of these the wrath of God is coming
In these you too once walked when you were living in them
But now you must put them all away anger wrath malice slander and obscene talk from your mouth
Do not lie to one another seeing that you have put off the old self with its practices
and have put on the new self which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator
Here there is not Greek and Jew circumcised and uncircumcised barbarian Scythian slave free but Christ is all and in all
Put on then as God s chosen ones holy and beloved compassionate hearts kindness humility meekness and patience
bearing with one another and if one has a complaint against another forgiving each other as the Lord has forgiven you so you also must forgive
And above all these put on love which binds everything together in perfect harmony
And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts to which indeed you were called in one body And be thankful
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs with thankfulness in your hearts to God
And whatever you do in word or deed do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God the Father through him
Wives submit to your husbands as is fitting in the Lord
Husbands love your wives and do not be harsh with them
Children obey your parents in everything for this pleases the Lord
Fathers do not provoke your children lest they become discouraged
Slaves obey in everything those who are your earthly masters not by way of eye service as people pleasers but with sincerity of heart fearing the Lord
Whatever you do work heartily as for the Lord and not for men
knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward You are serving the Lord Christ
For the wrongdoer will be paid back for the wrong he has done and there is no partiality
