Isaiah 29
Ah Ariel Ariel the city where David encamped Add year to year let the feasts run their round
Yet I will distress Ariel and there shall be moaning and lamentation and she shall be to me like an Ariel
And I will encamp against you all around and will besiege you with towers and I will raise siegeworks against you
And you will be brought low from the earth you shall speak and from the dust your speech will be bowed down your voice shall come from the ground like the voice of a ghost and from the dust your speech shall whisper
But the multitude of your foreign foes shall be like small dust and the multitude of the ruthless like passing chaff And in an instant suddenly
you will be visited by the LORD of hosts with thunder and with earthquake and great noise with whirlwind and tempest and the flame of a devouring fire
And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel all that fight against her and her stronghold and distress her shall be like a dream a vision of the night
As when a hungry man dreams he is eating and awakes with his hunger not satisfied or as when a thirsty man dreams he is drinking and awakes faint with his thirst not quenched so shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against Mount Zion
Astonish yourselves and be astonished blind yourselves and be blind Be drunk but not with wine stagger but not with strong drink
For the LORD has poured out upon you a spirit of deep sleep and has closed your eyes the prophets and covered your heads the seers
And the vision of all this has become to you like the words of a book that is sealed When men give it to one who can read saying Read this he says I cannot for it is sealed
And when they give the book to one who cannot read saying Read this he says I cannot read
And the Lord said Because this people draw near with their mouth and honor me with their lips while their hearts are far from me and their fear of me is a commandment taught by men
therefore behold I will again do wonderful things with this people with wonder upon wonder and the wisdom of their wise men shall perish and the discernment of their discerning men shall be hidden
Ah you who hide deep from the LORD your counsel whose deeds are in the dark and who say Who sees us Who knows us
You turn things upside down Shall the potter be regarded as the clay that the thing made should say of its maker He did not make me or the thing formed say of him who formed it He has no understanding
Is it not yet a very little while until Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field and the fruitful field shall be regarded as a forest
In that day the deaf shall hear the words of a book and out of their gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind shall see
The meek shall obtain fresh joy in the LORD and the poor among mankind shall exult in the Holy One of Israel
For the ruthless shall come to nothing and the scoffer cease and all who watch to do evil shall be cut off
who by a word make a man out to be an offender and lay a snare for him who reproves in the gate and with an empty plea turn aside him who is in the right
Therefore thus says the LORD who redeemed Abraham concerning the house of Jacob Jacob shall no more be ashamed no more shall his face grow pale
For when he sees his children the work of my hands in his midst they will sanctify my name they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob and will stand in awe of the God of Israel
And those who go astray in spirit will come to understanding and those who murmur will accept instruction
