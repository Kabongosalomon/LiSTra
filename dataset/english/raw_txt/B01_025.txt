Matthew 25
Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom
Five of them were foolish and five were wise
For when the foolish took their lamps they took no oil with them
but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps
As the bridegroom was delayed they all became drowsy and slept
But at midnight there was a cry Here is the bridegroom Come out to meet him
Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps
And the foolish said to the wise Give us some of your oil for our lamps are going out
But the wise answered saying Since there will not be enough for us and for you go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves
And while they were going to buy the bridegroom came and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast and the door was shut
Afterward the other virgins came also saying Lord lord open to us
But he answered Truly I say to you I do not know you
Watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour
For it will be like a man going on a journey who called his servants and entrusted to them his property
To one he gave five talents to another two to another one to each according to his ability Then he went away
He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them and he made five talents more
So also he who had the two talents made two talents more
But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master s money
Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them
And he who had received the five talents came forward bringing five talents more saying Master you delivered to me five talents here I have made five talents more
His master said to him Well done good and faithful servant You have been faithful over a little I will set you over much Enter into the joy of your master
And he also who had the two talents came forward saying Master you delivered to me two talents here I have made two talents more
His master said to him Well done good and faithful servant You have been faithful over a little I will set you over much Enter into the joy of your master
He also who had received the one talent came forward saying Master I knew you to be a hard man reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you scattered no seed
so I was afraid and I went and hid your talent in the ground Here you have what is yours
But his master answered him You wicked and slothful servant You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I scattered no seed
Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest
So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents
For to everyone who has will more be given and he will have an abundance But from the one who has not even what he has will be taken away
And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
When the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the angels with him then he will sit on his glorious throne
Before him will be gathered all the nations and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats
And he will place the sheep on his right but the goats on the left
Then the King will say to those on his right Come you who are blessed by my Father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world
For I was hungry and you gave me food I was thirsty and you gave me drink I was a stranger and you welcomed me
I was naked and you clothed me I was sick and you visited me I was in prison and you came to me
Then the righteous will answer him saying Lord when did we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you drink
And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you or naked and clothe you
And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you
And the King will answer them Truly I say to you as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers you did it to me
Then he will say to those on his left Depart from me you cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels
For I was hungry and you gave me no food I was thirsty and you gave me no drink
I was a stranger and you did not welcome me naked and you did not clothe me sick and in prison and you did not visit me
Then they also will answer saying Lord when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to you
Then he will answer them saying Truly I say to you as you did not do it to one of the least of these you did not do it to me
And these will go away into eternal punishment but the righteous into eternal life
