Isaiah 49
Listen to me O coastlands and give attention you peoples from afar The LORD called me from the womb from the body of my mother he named my name
He made my mouth like a sharp sword in the shadow of his hand he hid me he made me a polished arrow in his quiver he hid me away
And he said to me You are my servant Israel in whom I will be glorified
But I said I have labored in vain I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity yet surely my right is with the LORD and my recompense with my God
And now the LORD says he who formed me from the womb to be his servant to bring Jacob back to him and that Israel might be gathered to him for I am honored in the eyes of the LORD and my God has become my strength
he says It is too light a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to bring back the preserved of Israel I will make you as a light for the nations that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth
Thus says the LORD the Redeemer of Israel and his Holy One to one deeply despised abhorred by the nation the servant of rulers Kings shall see and arise princes and they shall prostrate themselves because of the LORD who is faithful the Holy One of Israel who has chosen you
Thus says the LORD In a time of favor I have answered you in a day of salvation I have helped you I will keep you and give you as a covenant to the people to establish the land to apportion the desolate heritages
saying to the prisoners Come out to those who are in darkness Appear They shall feed along the ways on all bare heights shall be their pasture
they shall not hunger or thirst neither scorching wind nor sun shall strike them for he who has pity on them will lead them and by springs of water will guide them
And I will make all my mountains a road and my highways shall be raised up
Behold these shall come from afar and behold these from the north and from the west and these from the land of Syene
Sing for joy O heavens and exult O earth break forth O mountains into singing For the LORD has comforted his people and will have compassion on his afflicted
But Zion said The LORD has forsaken me my Lord has forgotten me
Can a woman forget her nursing child that she should have no compassion on the son of her womb Even these may forget yet I will not forget you
Behold I have engraved you on the palms of my hands your walls are continually before me
Your builders make haste your destroyers and those who laid you waste go out from you
Lift up your eyes around and see they all gather they come to you As I live declares the LORD you shall put them all on as an ornament you shall bind them on as a bride does
Surely your waste and your desolate places and your devastated land surely now you will be too narrow for your inhabitants and those who swallowed you up will be far away
The children of your bereavement will yet say in your ears The place is too narrow for me make room for me to dwell in
Then you will say in your heart Who has borne me these I was bereaved and barren exiled and put away but who has brought up these Behold I was left alone from where have these come
Thus says the Lord GOD Behold I will lift up my hand to the nations and raise my signal to the peoples and they shall bring your sons in their bosom and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders
Kings shall be your foster fathers and their queens your nursing mothers With their faces to the ground they shall bow down to you and lick the dust of your feet Then you will know that I am the LORD those who wait for me shall not be put to shame
Can the prey be taken from the mighty or the captives of a tyrant be rescued
For thus says the LORD Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken and the prey of the tyrant be rescued for I will contend with those who contend with you and I will save your children
I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh and they shall be drunk with their own blood as with wine Then all flesh shall know that I am the LORD your Savior and your Redeemer the Mighty One of Jacob
