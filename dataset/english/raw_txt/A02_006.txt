Exodus 6
But the LORD said to Moses Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh for with a strong hand he will send them out and with a strong hand he will drive them out of his land
God spoke to Moses and said to him I am the LORD
I appeared to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob as God Almighty but by my name the LORD I did not make myself known to them
I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan the land in which they lived as sojourners
Moreover I have heard the groaning of the people of Israel whom the Egyptians hold as slaves and I have remembered my covenant
Say therefore to the people of Israel I am the LORD and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians and I will deliver you from slavery to them and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great acts of judgment
I will take you to be my people and I will be your God and you shall know that I am the LORD your God who has brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians
I will bring you into the land that I swore to give to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob I will give it to you for a possession I am the LORD
Moses spoke thus to the people of Israel but they did not listen to Moses because of their broken spirit and harsh slavery
So the LORD said to Moses
Go in tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the people of Israel go out of his land
But Moses said to the LORD Behold the people of Israel have not listened to me How then shall Pharaoh listen to me for I am of uncircumcised lips
But the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron and gave them a charge about the people of Israel and about Pharaoh king of Egypt to bring the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt
