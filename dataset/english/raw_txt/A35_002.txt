Habakkuk 2
I will take my stand at my watchpost and station myself on the tower and look out to see what he will say to me and what I will answer concerning my complaint
And the LORD answered me Write the vision make it plain on tablets so he may run who reads it
For still the vision awaits its appointed time it hastens to the end it will not lie If it seems slow wait for it it will surely come it will not delay
Behold his soul is puffed up it is not upright within him but the righteous shall live by his faith
Moreover wine is a traitor an arrogant man who is never at rest His greed is as wide as Sheol like death he has never enough He gathers for himself all nations and collects as his own all peoples
Shall not all these take up their taunt against him with scoffing and riddles for him and say Woe to him who heaps up what is not his own for how long and loads himself with pledges
Will not your debtors suddenly arise and those awake who will make you tremble Then you will be spoil for them
Because you have plundered many nations all the remnant of the peoples shall plunder you for the blood of man and violence to the earth to cities and all who dwell in them
Woe to him who gets evil gain for his house to set his nest on high to be safe from the reach of harm
You have devised shame for your house by cutting off many peoples you have forfeited your life
For the stone will cry out from the wall and the beam from the woodwork respond
Woe to him who builds a town with blood and founds a city on iniquity
Behold is it not from the LORD of hosts that peoples labor merely for fire and nations weary themselves for nothing
For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD as the waters cover the sea
Woe to him who makes his neighbors drink you pour out your wrath and make them drunk in order to gaze at their nakedness
You will have your fill of shame instead of glory Drink yourself and show your uncircumcision The cup in the LORD s right hand will come around to you and utter shame will come upon your glory
The violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you as will the destruction of the beasts that terrified them for the blood of man and violence to the earth to cities and all who dwell in them
What profit is an idol when its maker has shaped it a metal image a teacher of lies For its maker trusts in his own creation when he makes speechless idols
Woe to him who says to a wooden thing Awake to a silent stone Arise Can this teach Behold it is overlaid with gold and silver and there is no breath at all in it
But the LORD is in his holy temple let all the earth keep silence before him
