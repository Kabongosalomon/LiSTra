Mark 1
The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ the Son of God
As it is written in Isaiah the prophet Behold I send my messenger before your face who will prepare your way
the voice of one crying in the wilderness Prepare the way of the Lord make his paths straight
John appeared baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins
And all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan confessing their sins
Now John was clothed with camel s hair and wore a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey
And he preached saying After me comes he who is mightier than I the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie
I have baptized you with water but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit
In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan
And when he came up out of the water immediately he saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove
And a voice came from heaven You are my beloved Son with you I am well pleased
The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness
And he was in the wilderness forty days being tempted by Satan And he was with the wild animals and the angels were ministering to him
Now after John was arrested Jesus came into Galilee proclaiming the gospel of God
and saying The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand repent and believe in the gospel
Passing alongside the Sea of Galilee he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea for they were fishermen
And Jesus said to them Follow me and I will make you become fishers of men
And immediately they left their nets and followed him
And going on a little farther he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother who were in their boat mending the nets
And immediately he called them and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and followed him
And they went into Capernaum and immediately on the Sabbath he entered the synagogue and was teaching
And they were astonished at his teaching for he taught them as one who had authority and not as the scribes
And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit And he cried out
What have you to do with us Jesus of Nazareth Have you come to destroy us I know who you are the Holy One of God
But Jesus rebuked him saying Be silent and come out of him
And the unclean spirit convulsing him and crying out with a loud voice came out of him
And they were all amazed so that they questioned among themselves saying What is this A new teaching with authority He commands even the unclean spirits and they obey him
And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee
And immediately he left the synagogue and entered the house of Simon and Andrew with James and John
Now Simon s mother in law lay ill with a fever and immediately they told him about her
And he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up and the fever left her and she began to serve them
That evening at sundown they brought to him all who were sick or oppressed by demons
And the whole city was gathered together at the door
And he healed many who were sick with various diseases and cast out many demons And he would not permit the demons to speak because they knew him
And rising very early in the morning while it was still dark he departed and went out to a desolate place and there he prayed
And Simon and those who were with him searched for him
and they found him and said to him Everyone is looking for you
And he said to them Let us go on to the next towns that I may preach there also for that is why I came out
And he went throughout all Galilee preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons
And a leper came to him imploring him and kneeling said to him If you will you can make me clean
Moved with pity he stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him I will be clean
And immediately the leprosy left him and he was made clean
And Jesus sternly charged him and sent him away at once
and said to him See that you say nothing to anyone but go show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded for a proof to them
But he went out and began to talk freely about it and to spread the news so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town but was out in desolate places and people were coming to him from every quarter
