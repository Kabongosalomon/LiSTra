Ezekiel 28
The word of the LORD came to me
Son of man say to the prince of Tyre Thus says the Lord GOD Because your heart is proud and you have said I am a god I sit in the seat of the gods in the heart of the seas yet you are but a man and no god though you make your heart like the heart of a god
you are indeed wiser than Daniel no secret is hidden from you
by your wisdom and your understanding you have made wealth for yourself and have gathered gold and silver into your treasuries
by your great wisdom in your trade you have increased your wealth and your heart has become proud in your wealth
therefore thus says the Lord GOD Because you make your heart like the heart of a god
therefore behold I will bring foreigners upon you the most ruthless of the nations and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom and defile your splendor
They shall thrust you down into the pit and you shall die the death of the slain in the heart of the seas
Will you still say I am a god in the presence of those who kill you though you are but a man and no god in the hands of those who slay you
You shall die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of foreigners for I have spoken declares the Lord GOD
Moreover the word of the LORD came to me
Son of man raise a lamentation over the king of Tyre and say to him Thus says the Lord GOD You were the signet of perfection full of wisdom and perfect in beauty
You were in Eden the garden of God every precious stone was your covering sardius topaz and diamond beryl onyx and jasper sapphire emerald and carbuncle and crafted in gold were your settings and your engravings On the day that you were created they were prepared
You were an anointed guardian cherub I placed you you were on the holy mountain of God in the midst of the stones of fire you walked
You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created till unrighteousness was found in you
In the abundance of your trade you were filled with violence in your midst and you sinned so I cast you as a profane thing from the mountain of God and I destroyed you O guardian cherub from the midst of the stones of fire
Your heart was proud because of your beauty you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor I cast you to the ground I exposed you before kings to feast their eyes on you
By the multitude of your iniquities in the unrighteousness of your trade you profaned your sanctuaries so I brought fire out from your midst it consumed you and I turned you to ashes on the earth in the sight of all who saw you
All who know you among the peoples are appalled at you you have come to a dreadful end and shall be no more forever
The word of the LORD came to me
Son of man set your face toward Sidon and prophesy against her
and say Thus says the Lord GOD Behold I am against you O Sidon and I will manifest my glory in your midst And they shall know that I am the LORD when I execute judgments in her and manifest my holiness in her
for I will send pestilence into her and blood into her streets and the slain shall fall in her midst by the sword that is against her on every side Then they will know that I am the LORD
And for the house of Israel there shall be no more a brier to prick or a thorn to hurt them among all their neighbors who have treated them with contempt Then they will know that I am the Lord GOD
Thus says the Lord GOD When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered and manifest my holiness in them in the sight of the nations then they shall dwell in their own land that I gave to my servant Jacob
And they shall dwell securely in it and they shall build houses and plant vineyards They shall dwell securely when I execute judgments upon all their neighbors who have treated them with contempt Then they will know that I am the LORD their God
