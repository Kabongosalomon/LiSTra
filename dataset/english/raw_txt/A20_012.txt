Proverbs 12
Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge but he who hates reproof is stupid
A good man obtains favor from the LORD but a man of evil devices he condemns
No one is established by wickedness but the root of the righteous will never be moved
An excellent wife is the crown of her husband but she who brings shame is like rottenness in his bones
The thoughts of the righteous are just the counsels of the wicked are deceitful
The words of the wicked lie in wait for blood but the mouth of the upright delivers them
The wicked are overthrown and are no more but the house of the righteous will stand
A man is commended according to his good sense but one of twisted mind is despised
Better to be lowly and have a servant than to play the great man and lack bread
Whoever is righteous has regard for the life of his beast but the mercy of the wicked is cruel
Whoever works his land will have plenty of bread but he who follows worthless pursuits lacks sense
Whoever is wicked covets the spoil of evildoers but the root of the righteous bears fruit
An evil man is ensnared by the transgression of his lips but the righteous escapes from trouble
From the fruit of his mouth a man is satisfied with good and the work of a man s hand comes back to him
The way of a fool is right in his own eyes but a wise man listens to advice
The vexation of a fool is known at once but the prudent ignores an insult
Whoever speaks the truth gives honest evidence but a false witness utters deceit
There is one whose rash words are like sword thrusts but the tongue of the wise brings healing
Truthful lips endure forever but a lying tongue is but for a moment
Deceit is in the heart of those who devise evil but those who plan peace have joy
No ill befalls the righteous but the wicked are filled with trouble
Lying lips are an abomination to the LORD but those who act faithfully are his delight
A prudent man conceals knowledge but the heart of fools proclaims folly
The hand of the diligent will rule while the slothful will be put to forced labor
Anxiety in a man s heart weighs him down but a good word makes him glad
One who is righteous is a guide to his neighbor but the way of the wicked leads them astray
Whoever is slothful will not roast his game but the diligent man will get precious wealth
In the path of righteousness is life and in its pathway there is no death
