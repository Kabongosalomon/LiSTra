Mark 8
In those days when again a great crowd had gathered and they had nothing to eat he called his disciples to him and said to them
I have compassion on the crowd because they have been with me now three days and have nothing to eat
And if I send them away hungry to their homes they will faint on the way And some of them have come from far away
And his disciples answered him How can one feed these people with bread here in this desolate place
And he asked them How many loaves do you have They said Seven
And he directed the crowd to sit down on the ground And he took the seven loaves and having given thanks he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people and they set them before the crowd
And they had a few small fish And having blessed them he said that these also should be set before them
And they ate and were satisfied And they took up the broken pieces left over seven baskets full
And there were about four thousand people And he sent them away
And immediately he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha
The Pharisees came and began to argue with him seeking from him a sign from heaven to test him
And he sighed deeply in his spirit and said Why does this generation seek a sign Truly I say to you no sign will be given to this generation
And he left them got into the boat again and went to the other side
Now they had forgotten to bring bread and they had only one loaf with them in the boat
And he cautioned them saying Watch out beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod
And they began discussing with one another the fact that they had no bread
And Jesus aware of this said to them Why are you discussing the fact that you have no bread Do you not yet perceive or understand Are your hearts hardened
Having eyes do you not see and having ears do you not hear And do you not remember
When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up They said to him Twelve
And the seven for the four thousand how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up And they said to him Seven
And he said to them Do you not yet understand
And they came to Bethsaida And some people brought to him a blind man and begged him to touch him
And he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village and when he had spit on his eyes and laid his hands on him he asked him Do you see anything
And he looked up and said I see men but they look like trees walking
Then Jesus laid his hands on his eyes again and he opened his eyes his sight was restored and he saw everything clearly
And he sent him to his home saying Do not even enter the village
And Jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi And on the way he asked his disciples Who do people say that I am
And they told him John the Baptist and others say Elijah and others one of the prophets
And he asked them But who do you say that I am Peter answered him You are the Christ
And he strictly charged them to tell no one about him
And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed and after three days rise again
And he said this plainly And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him
But turning and seeing his disciples he rebuked Peter and said Get behind me Satan For you are not setting your mind on the things of God but on the things of man
And calling the crowd to him with his disciples he said to them If anyone would come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me
For whoever would save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel s will save it
For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul
For what can a man give in return for his soul
For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels
