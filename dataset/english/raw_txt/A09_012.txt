1 Samuel 12
And Samuel said to all Israel Behold I have obeyed your voice in all that you have said to me and have made a king over you
And now behold the king walks before you and I am old and gray and behold my sons are with you I have walked before you from my youth until this day
Here I am testify against me before the LORD and before his anointed Whose ox have I taken Or whose donkey have I taken Or whom have I defrauded Whom have I oppressed Or from whose hand have I taken a bribe to blind my eyes with it Testify against me and I will restore it to you
They said You have not defrauded us or oppressed us or taken anything from any man s hand
And he said to them The LORD is witness against you and his anointed is witness this day that you have not found anything in my hand And they said He is witness
And Samuel said to the people The LORD is witness who appointed Moses and Aaron and brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt
Now therefore stand still that I may plead with you before the LORD concerning all the righteous deeds of the LORD that he performed for you and for your fathers
When Jacob went into Egypt and the Egyptians oppressed them then your fathers cried out to the LORD and the LORD sent Moses and Aaron who brought your fathers out of Egypt and made them dwell in this place
But they forgot the LORD their God And he sold them into the hand of Sisera commander of the army of Hazor and into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the king of Moab And they fought against them
And they cried out to the LORD and said We have sinned because we have forsaken the LORD and have served the Baals and the Ashtaroth But now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies that we may serve you
And the LORD sent Jerubbaal and Barak and Jephthah and Samuel and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side and you lived in safety
And when you saw that Nahash the king of the Ammonites came against you you said to me No but a king shall reign over us when the LORD your God was your king
And now behold the king whom you have chosen for whom you have asked behold the LORD has set a king over you
If you will fear the LORD and serve him and obey his voice and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD and if both you and the king who reigns over you will follow the LORD your God it will be well
But if you will not obey the voice of the LORD but rebel against the commandment of the LORD then the hand of the LORD will be against you and your king
Now therefore stand still and see this great thing that the LORD will do before your eyes
Is it not wheat harvest today I will call upon the LORD that he may send thunder and rain And you shall know and see that your wickedness is great which you have done in the sight of the LORD in asking for yourselves a king
So Samuel called upon the LORD and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel
And all the people said to Samuel Pray for your servants to the LORD your God that we may not die for we have added to all our sins this evil to ask for ourselves a king
And Samuel said to the people Do not be afraid you have done all this evil Yet do not turn aside from following the LORD but serve the LORD with all your heart
And do not turn aside after empty things that cannot profit or deliver for they are empty
For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name s sake because it has pleased the LORD to make you a people for himself
Moreover as for me far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD by ceasing to pray for you and I will instruct you in the good and the right way
Only fear the LORD and serve him faithfully with all your heart For consider what great things he has done for you
But if you still do wickedly you shall be swept away both you and your king
