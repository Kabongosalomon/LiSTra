1 Chronicles 17
Now when David lived in his house David said to Nathan the prophet Behold I dwell in a house of cedar but the ark of the covenant of the LORD is under a tent
And Nathan said to David Do all that is in your heart for God is with you
But that same night the word of the LORD came to Nathan
Go and tell my servant David Thus says the LORD It is not you who will build me a house to dwell in
For I have not lived in a house since the day I brought up Israel to this day but I have gone from tent to tent and from dwelling to dwelling
In all places where I have moved with all Israel did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel whom I commanded to shepherd my people saying Why have you not built me a house of cedar
Now therefore thus shall you say to my servant David Thus says the LORD of hosts I took you from the pasture from following the sheep to be prince over my people Israel
and I have been with you wherever you have gone and have cut off all your enemies from before you And I will make for you a name like the name of the great ones of the earth
And I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them that they may dwell in their own place and be disturbed no more And violent men shall waste them no more as formerly
from the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel And I will subdue all your enemies Moreover I declare to you that the LORD will build you a house
When your days are fulfilled to walk with your fathers I will raise up your offspring after you one of your own sons and I will establish his kingdom
He shall build a house for me and I will establish his throne forever
I will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son I will not take my steadfast love from him as I took it from him who was before you
but I will confirm him in my house and in my kingdom forever and his throne shall be established forever
In accordance with all these words and in accordance with all this vision Nathan spoke to David
Then King David went in and sat before the LORD and said Who am I O LORD God and what is my house that you have brought me thus far
And this was a small thing in your eyes O God You have also spoken of your servant s house for a great while to come and have shown me future generations O LORD God
And what more can David say to you for honoring your servant For you know your servant
For your servant s sake O LORD and according to your own heart you have done all this greatness in making known all these great things
There is none like you O LORD and there is no God besides you according to all that we have heard with our ears
And who is like your people Israel the one nation on earth whom God went to redeem to be his people making for yourself a name for great and awesome things in driving out nations before your people whom you redeemed from Egypt
And you made your people Israel to be your people forever and you O LORD became their God
And now O LORD let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house be established forever and do as you have spoken
and your name will be established and magnified forever saying The LORD of hosts the God of Israel is Israel s God and the house of your servant David will be established before you
For you my God have revealed to your servant that you will build a house for him Therefore your servant has found courage to pray before you
And now O LORD you are God and you have promised this good thing to your servant
Now you have been pleased to bless the house of your servant that it may continue forever before you for it is you O LORD who have blessed and it is blessed forever
