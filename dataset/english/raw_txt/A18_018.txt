Job 18
Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said
How long will you hunt for words Consider and then we will speak
Why are we counted as cattle Why are we stupid in your sight
You who tear yourself in your anger shall the earth be forsaken for you or the rock be removed out of its place
Indeed the light of the wicked is put out and the flame of his fire does not shine
The light is dark in his tent and his lamp above him is put out
His strong steps are shortened and his own schemes throw him down
For he is cast into a net by his own feet and he walks on its mesh
A trap seizes him by the heel a snare lays hold of him
A rope is hidden for him in the ground a trap for him in the path
Terrors frighten him on every side and chase him at his heels
His strength is famished and calamity is ready for his stumbling
It consumes the parts of his skin the firstborn of death consumes his limbs
He is torn from the tent in which he trusted and is brought to the king of terrors
In his tent dwells that which is none of his sulfur is scattered over his habitation
His roots dry up beneath and his branches wither above
His memory perishes from the earth and he has no name in the street
He is thrust from light into darkness and driven out of the world
He has no posterity or progeny among his people and no survivor where he used to live
They of the west are appalled at his day and horror seizes them of the east
Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous such is the place of him who knows not God
