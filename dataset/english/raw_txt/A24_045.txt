Jeremiah 45
The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah when he wrote these words in a book at the dictation of Jeremiah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah
Thus says the LORD the God of Israel to you O Baruch
You said Woe is me For the LORD has added sorrow to my pain I am weary with my groaning and I find no rest
Thus shall you say to him Thus says the LORD Behold what I have built I am breaking down and what I have planted I am plucking up that is the whole land
And do you seek great things for yourself Seek them not for behold I am bringing disaster upon all flesh declares the LORD But I will give you your life as a prize of war in all places to which you may go
