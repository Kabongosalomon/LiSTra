James 3
Not many of you should become teachers my brothers for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness
For we all stumble in many ways And if anyone does not stumble in what he says he is a perfect man able also to bridle his whole body
If we put bits into the mouths of horses so that they obey us we guide their whole bodies as well
Look at the ships also though they are so large and are driven by strong winds they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs
So also the tongue is a small member yet it boasts of great things How great a forest is set ablaze by such a small fire
And the tongue is a fire a world of unrighteousness The tongue is set among our members staining the whole body setting on fire the entire course of life and set on fire by hell
For every kind of beast and bird of reptile and sea creature can be tamed and has been tamed by mankind
but no human being can tame the tongue It is a restless evil full of deadly poison
With it we bless our Lord and Father and with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of God
From the same mouth come blessing and cursing My brothers these things ought not to be so
Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and salt water
Can a fig tree my brothers bear olives or a grapevine produce figs Neither can a salt pond yield fresh water
Who is wise and understanding among you By his good conduct let him show his works in the meekness of wisdom
But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts do not boast and be false to the truth
This is not the wisdom that comes down from above but is earthly unspiritual demonic
For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist there will be disorder and every vile practice
But the wisdom from above is first pure then peaceable gentle open to reason full of mercy and good fruits impartial and sincere
And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace
