2 Chronicles 11
When Rehoboam came to Jerusalem he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin chosen warriors to fight against Israel to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam
But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God
Say to Rehoboam the son of Solomon king of Judah and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin
Thus says the LORD You shall not go up or fight against your relatives Return every man to his home for this thing is from me So they listened to the word of the LORD and returned and did not go against Jeroboam
Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem and he built cities for defense in Judah
He built Bethlehem Etam Tekoa
Beth zur Soco Adullam
Gath Mareshah Ziph
Adoraim Lachish Azekah
Zorah Aijalon and Hebron fortified cities that are in Judah and in Benjamin
He made the fortresses strong and put commanders in them and stores of food oil and wine
And he put shields and spears in all the cities and made them very strong So he held Judah and Benjamin
And the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel presented themselves to him from all places where they lived
For the Levites left their common lands and their holdings and came to Judah and Jerusalem because Jeroboam and his sons cast them out from serving as priests of the LORD
and he appointed his own priests for the high places and for the goat idols and for the calves that he had made
And those who had set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came after them from all the tribes of Israel to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the LORD the God of their fathers
They strengthened the kingdom of Judah and for three years they made Rehoboam the son of Solomon secure for they walked for three years in the way of David and Solomon
Rehoboam took as wife Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse
and she bore him sons Jeush Shemariah and Zaham
After her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom who bore him Abijah Attai Ziza and Shelomith
Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and concubines he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines and fathered twenty eight sons and sixty daughters
And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah as chief prince among his brothers for he intended to make him king
And he dealt wisely and distributed some of his sons through all the districts of Judah and Benjamin in all the fortified cities and he gave them abundant provisions and procured wives for them
