Romans 1
Paul a servant of Christ Jesus called to be an apostle set apart for the gospel of God
which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures
concerning his Son who was descended from David according to the flesh
and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead Jesus Christ our Lord
through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations
including you who are called to belong to Jesus Christ
To all those in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
First I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you because your faith is proclaimed in all the world
For God is my witness whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son that without ceasing I mention you
always in my prayers asking that somehow by God s will I may now at last succeed in coming to you
For I long to see you that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you
that is that we may be mutually encouraged by each other s faith both yours and mine
I want you to know brothers that I have often intended to come to you but thus far have been prevented in order that I may reap some harvest among you as well as among the rest of the Gentiles
I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians both to the wise and to the foolish
So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome
For I am not ashamed of the gospel for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes to the Jew first and also to the Greek
For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith as it is written The righteous shall live by faith
For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth
For what can be known about God is plain to them because God has shown it to them
For his invisible attributes namely his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly perceived ever since the creation of the world in the things that have been made So they are without excuse
For although they knew God they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him but they became futile in their thinking and their foolish hearts were darkened
Claiming to be wise they became fools
and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things
Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves
because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator who is blessed forever Amen
For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature
and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error
And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done
They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness evil covetousness malice They are full of envy murder strife deceit maliciousness They are gossips
slanderers haters of God insolent haughty boastful inventors of evil disobedient to parents
foolish faithless heartless ruthless
Though they know God s decree that those who practice such things deserve to die they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them
