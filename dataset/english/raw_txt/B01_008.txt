Matthew 8
When he came down from the mountain great crowds followed him
And behold a leper came to him and knelt before him saying Lord if you will you can make me clean
And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him saying I will be clean And immediately his leprosy was cleansed
And Jesus said to him See that you say nothing to anyone but go show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded for a proof to them
When he entered Capernaum a centurion came forward to him appealing to him
Lord my servant is lying paralyzed at home suffering terribly
And he said to him I will come and heal him
But the centurion replied Lord I am not worthy to have you come under my roof but only say the word and my servant will be healed
For I too am a man under authority with soldiers under me And I say to one Go and he goes and to another Come and he comes and to my servant Do this and he does it
When Jesus heard this he marveled and said to those who followed him Truly I tell you with no one in Israel have I found such faith
I tell you many will come from east and west and recline at table with Abraham Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven
while the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
And to the centurion Jesus said Go let it be done for you as you have believed And the servant was healed at that very moment
And when Jesus entered Peter s house he saw his mother in law lying sick with a fever
He touched her hand and the fever left her and she rose and began to serve him
That evening they brought to him many who were oppressed by demons and he cast out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick
This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah He took our illnesses and bore our diseases
Now when Jesus saw a crowd around him he gave orders to go over to the other side
And a scribe came up and said to him Teacher I will follow you wherever you go
And Jesus said to him Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head
Another of the disciples said to him Lord let me first go and bury my father
And Jesus said to him Follow me and leave the dead to bury their own dead
And when he got into the boat his disciples followed him
And behold there arose a great storm on the sea so that the boat was being swamped by the waves but he was asleep
And they went and woke him saying Save us Lord we are perishing
And he said to them Why are you afraid O you of little faith Then he rose and rebuked the winds and the sea and there was a great calm
And the men marveled saying What sort of man is this that even winds and sea obey him
And when he came to the other side to the country of the Gadarenes two demon possessed men met him coming out of the tombs so fierce that no one could pass that way
And behold they cried out What have you to do with us O Son of God Have you come here to torment us before the time
Now a herd of many pigs was feeding at some distance from them
And the demons begged him saying If you cast us out send us away into the herd of pigs
And he said to them Go So they came out and went into the pigs and behold the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the waters
The herdsmen fled and going into the city they told everything especially what had happened to the demon possessed men
And behold all the city came out to meet Jesus and when they saw him they begged him to leave their region
