Exodus 12
The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt
This month shall be for you the beginning of months It shall be the first month of the year for you
Tell all the congregation of Israel that on the tenth day of this month every man shall take a lamb according to their fathers houses a lamb for a household
And if the household is too small for a lamb then he and his nearest neighbor shall take according to the number of persons according to what each can eat you shall make your count for the lamb
Your lamb shall be without blemish a male a year old You may take it from the sheep or from the goats
and you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month when the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill their lambs at twilight
Then they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses in which they eat it
They shall eat the flesh that night roasted on the fire with unleavened bread and bitter herbs they shall eat it
Do not eat any of it raw or boiled in water but roasted its head with its legs and its inner parts
And you shall let none of it remain until the morning anything that remains until the morning you shall burn
In this manner you shall eat it with your belt fastened your sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand And you shall eat it in haste It is the LORD s Passover
For I will pass through the land of Egypt that night and I will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and beast and on all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments I am the LORD
The blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you are And when I see the blood I will pass over you and no plague will befall you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt
This day shall be for you a memorial day and you shall keep it as a feast to the LORD throughout your generations as a statute forever you shall keep it as a feast
Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread On the first day you shall remove leaven out of your houses for if anyone eats what is leavened from the first day until the seventh day that person shall be cut off from Israel
On the first day you shall hold a holy assembly and on the seventh day a holy assembly No work shall be done on those days But what everyone needs to eat that alone may be prepared by you
And you shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread for on this very day I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt Therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations as a statute forever
In the first month from the fourteenth day of the month at evening you shall eat unleavened bread until the twenty first day of the month at evening
For seven days no leaven is to be found in your houses If anyone eats what is leavened that person will be cut off from the congregation of Israel whether he is a sojourner or a native of the land
You shall eat nothing leavened in all your dwelling places you shall eat unleavened bread
Then Moses called all the elders of Israel and said to them Go and select lambs for yourselves according to your clans and kill the Passover lamb
Take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood that is in the basin and touch the lintel and the two doorposts with the blood that is in the basin None of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning
For the LORD will pass through to strike the Egyptians and when he sees the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts the LORD will pass over the door and will not allow the destroyer to enter your houses to strike you
You shall observe this rite as a statute for you and for your sons forever
And when you come to the land that the LORD will give you as he has promised you shall keep this service
And when your children say to you What do you mean by this service
you shall say It is the sacrifice of the LORD s Passover for he passed over the houses of the people of Israel in Egypt when he struck the Egyptians but spared our houses And the people bowed their heads and worshiped
Then the people of Israel went and did so as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron so they did
At midnight the LORD struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon and all the firstborn of the livestock
And Pharaoh rose up in the night he and all his servants and all the Egyptians And there was a great cry in Egypt for there was not a house where someone was not dead
Then he summoned Moses and Aaron by night and said Up go out from among my people both you and the people of Israel and go serve the LORD as you have said
Take your flocks and your herds as you have said and be gone and bless me also
The Egyptians were urgent with the people to send them out of the land in haste For they said We shall all be dead
So the people took their dough before it was leavened their kneading bowls being bound up in their cloaks on their shoulders
The people of Israel had also done as Moses told them for they had asked the Egyptians for silver and gold jewelry and for clothing
And the LORD had given the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians so that they let them have what they asked Thus they plundered the Egyptians
And the people of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth about six hundred thousand men on foot besides women and children
A mixed multitude also went up with them and very much livestock both flocks and herds
And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough that they had brought out of Egypt for it was not leavened because they were thrust out of Egypt and could not wait nor had they prepared any provisions for themselves
The time that the people of Israel lived in Egypt was years
At the end of years on that very day all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt
It was a night of watching by the LORD to bring them out of the land of Egypt so this same night is a night of watching kept to the LORD by all the people of Israel throughout their generations
And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron This is the statute of the Passover no foreigner shall eat of it
but every slave that is bought for money may eat of it after you have circumcised him
No foreigner or hired servant may eat of it
It shall be eaten in one house you shall not take any of the flesh outside the house and you shall not break any of its bones
All the congregation of Israel shall keep it
If a stranger shall sojourn with you and would keep the Passover to the LORD let all his males be circumcised Then he may come near and keep it he shall be as a native of the land But no uncircumcised person shall eat of it
There shall be one law for the native and for the stranger who sojourns among you
All the people of Israel did just as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron
And on that very day the LORD brought the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their hosts
