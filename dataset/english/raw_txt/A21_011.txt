Ecclesiastes 11
Cast your bread upon the waters for you will find it after many days
Give a portion to seven or even to eight for you know not what disaster may happen on earth
If the clouds are full of rain they empty themselves on the earth and if a tree falls to the south or to the north in the place where the tree falls there it will lie
He who observes the wind will not sow and he who regards the clouds will not reap
As you do not know the way the spirit comes to the bones in the womb of a woman with child so you do not know the work of God who makes everything
In the morning sow your seed and at evening withhold not your hand for you do not know which will prosper this or that or whether both alike will be good
Light is sweet and it is pleasant for the eyes to see the sun
So if a person lives many years let him rejoice in them all but let him remember that the days of darkness will be many All that comes is vanity
Rejoice O young man in your youth and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth Walk in the ways of your heart and the sight of your eyes But know that for all these things God will bring you into judgment
Remove vexation from your heart and put away pain from your body for youth and the dawn of life are vanity
