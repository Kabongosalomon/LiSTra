Exodus 15
Then Moses and the people of Israel sang this song to the LORD saying I will sing to the LORD for he has triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea
The LORD is my strength and my song and he has become my salvation this is my God and I will praise him my father s God and I will exalt him
The LORD is a man of war the LORD is his name
Pharaoh s chariots and his host he cast into the sea and his chosen officers were sunk in the Red Sea
The floods covered them they went down into the depths like a stone
Your right hand O LORD glorious in power your right hand O LORD shatters the enemy
In the greatness of your majesty you overthrow your adversaries you send out your fury it consumes them like stubble
At the blast of your nostrils the waters piled up the floods stood up in a heap the deeps congealed in the heart of the sea
The enemy said I will pursue I will overtake I will divide the spoil my desire shall have its fill of them I will draw my sword my hand shall destroy them
You blew with your wind the sea covered them they sank like lead in the mighty waters
Who is like you O LORD among the gods Who is like you majestic in holiness awesome in glorious deeds doing wonders
You stretched out your right hand the earth swallowed them
You have led in your steadfast love the people whom you have redeemed you have guided them by your strength to your holy abode
The peoples have heard they tremble pangs have seized the inhabitants of Philistia
Now are the chiefs of Edom dismayed trembling seizes the leaders of Moab all the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away
Terror and dread fall upon them because of the greatness of your arm they are still as a stone till your people O LORD pass by till the people pass by whom you have purchased
You will bring them in and plant them on your own mountain the place O LORD which you have made for your abode the sanctuary O Lord which your hands have established
The LORD will reign forever and ever
For when the horses of Pharaoh with his chariots and his horsemen went into the sea the LORD brought back the waters of the sea upon them but the people of Israel walked on dry ground in the midst of the sea
Then Miriam the prophetess the sister of Aaron took a tambourine in her hand and all the women went out after her with tambourines and dancing
And Miriam sang to them Sing to the LORD for he has triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea
Then Moses made Israel set out from the Red Sea and they went into the wilderness of Shur They went three days in the wilderness and found no water
When they came to Marah they could not drink the water of Marah because it was bitter therefore it was named Marah
And the people grumbled against Moses saying What shall we drink
And he cried to the LORD and the LORD showed him a log and he threw it into the water and the water became sweet There the LORD made for them a statute and a rule and there he tested them
saying If you will diligently listen to the voice of the LORD your God and do that which is right in his eyes and give ear to his commandments and keep all his statutes I will put none of the diseases on you that I put on the Egyptians for I am the LORD your healer
Then they came to Elim where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees and they encamped there by the water
