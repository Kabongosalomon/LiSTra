Ezekiel 22
And the word of the LORD came to me saying
And you son of man will you judge will you judge the bloody city Then declare to her all her abominations
You shall say Thus says the Lord GOD A city that sheds blood in her midst so that her time may come and that makes idols to defile herself
You have become guilty by the blood that you have shed and defiled by the idols that you have made and you have brought your days near the appointed time of your years has come Therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations and a mockery to all the countries
Those who are near and those who are far from you will mock you your name is defiled you are full of tumult
Behold the princes of Israel in you every one according to his power have been bent on shedding blood
Father and mother are treated with contempt in you the sojourner suffers extortion in your midst the fatherless and the widow are wronged in you
You have despised my holy things and profaned my Sabbaths
There are men in you who slander to shed blood and people in you who eat on the mountains they commit lewdness in your midst
In you men uncover their fathers nakedness in you they violate women who are unclean in their menstrual impurity
One commits abomination with his neighbor s wife another lewdly defiles his daughter in law another in you violates his sister his father s daughter
In you they take bribes to shed blood you take interest and profit and make gain of your neighbors by extortion but me you have forgotten declares the Lord GOD
Behold I strike my hand at the dishonest gain that you have made and at the blood that has been in your midst
Can your courage endure or can your hands be strong in the days that I shall deal with you I the LORD have spoken and I will do it
I will scatter you among the nations and disperse you through the countries and I will consume your uncleanness out of you
And you shall be profaned by your own doing in the sight of the nations and you shall know that I am the LORD
And the word of the LORD came to me
Son of man the house of Israel has become dross to me all of them are bronze and tin and iron and lead in the furnace they are dross of silver
Therefore thus says the Lord GOD Because you have all become dross therefore behold I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem
As one gathers silver and bronze and iron and lead and tin into a furnace to blow the fire on it in order to melt it so I will gather you in my anger and in my wrath and I will put you in and melt you
I will gather you and blow on you with the fire of my wrath and you shall be melted in the midst of it
As silver is melted in a furnace so you shall be melted in the midst of it and you shall know that I am the LORD I have poured out my wrath upon you
And the word of the LORD came to me
Son of man say to her You are a land that is not cleansed or rained upon in the day of indignation
The conspiracy of her prophets in her midst is like a roaring lion tearing the prey they have devoured human lives they have taken treasure and precious things they have made many widows in her midst
Her priests have done violence to my law and have profaned my holy things They have made no distinction between the holy and the common neither have they taught the difference between the unclean and the clean and they have disregarded my Sabbaths so that I am profaned among them
Her princes in her midst are like wolves tearing the prey shedding blood destroying lives to get dishonest gain
And her prophets have smeared whitewash for them seeing false visions and divining lies for them saying Thus says the Lord GOD when the LORD has not spoken
The people of the land have practiced extortion and committed robbery They have oppressed the poor and needy and have extorted from the sojourner without justice
And I sought for a man among them who should build up the wall and stand in the breach before me for the land that I should not destroy it but I found none
Therefore I have poured out my indignation upon them I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath I have returned their way upon their heads declares the Lord GOD
