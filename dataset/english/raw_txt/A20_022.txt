Proverbs 22
A good name is to be chosen rather than great riches and favor is better than silver or gold
The rich and the poor meet together the LORD is the maker of them all
The prudent sees danger and hides himself but the simple go on and suffer for it
The reward for humility and fear of the LORD is riches and honor and life
Thorns and snares are in the way of the crooked whoever guards his soul will keep far from them
Train up a child in the way he should go even when he is old he will not depart from it
The rich rules over the poor and the borrower is the slave of the lender
Whoever sows injustice will reap calamity and the rod of his fury will fail
Whoever has a bountiful eye will be blessed for he shares his bread with the poor
Drive out a scoffer and strife will go out and quarreling and abuse will cease
He who loves purity of heart and whose speech is gracious will have the king as his friend
The eyes of the LORD keep watch over knowledge but he overthrows the words of the traitor
The sluggard says There is a lion outside I shall be killed in the streets
The mouth of forbidden women is a deep pit he with whom the LORD is angry will fall into it
Folly is bound up in the heart of a child but the rod of discipline drives it far from him
Whoever oppresses the poor to increase his own wealth or gives to the rich will only come to poverty
Incline your ear and hear the words of the wise and apply your heart to my knowledge
for it will be pleasant if you keep them within you if all of them are ready on your lips
That your trust may be in the LORD I have made them known to you today even to you
Have I not written for you thirty sayings of counsel and knowledge
to make you know what is right and true that you may give a true answer to those who sent you
Do not rob the poor because he is poor or crush the afflicted at the gate
for the LORD will plead their cause and rob of life those who rob them
Make no friendship with a man given to anger nor go with a wrathful man
lest you learn his ways and entangle yourself in a snare
Be not one of those who give pledges who put up security for debts
If you have nothing with which to pay why should your bed be taken from under you
Do not move the ancient landmark that your fathers have set
Do you see a man skillful in his work He will stand before kings he will not stand before obscure men
