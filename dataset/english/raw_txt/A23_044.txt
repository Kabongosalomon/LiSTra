Isaiah 44
But now hear O Jacob my servant Israel whom I have chosen
Thus says the LORD who made you who formed you from the womb and will help you Fear not O Jacob my servant Jeshurun whom I have chosen
For I will pour water on the thirsty land and streams on the dry ground I will pour my Spirit upon your offspring and my blessing on your descendants
They shall spring up among the grass like willows by flowing streams
This one will say I am the LORD s another will call on the name of Jacob and another will write on his hand The LORD s and name himself by the name of Israel
Thus says the LORD the King of Israel and his Redeemer the LORD of hosts I am the first and I am the last besides me there is no god
Who is like me Let him proclaim it Let him declare and set it before me since I appointed an ancient people Let them declare what is to come and what will happen
Fear not nor be afraid have I not told you from of old and declared it And you are my witnesses Is there a God besides me There is no Rock I know not any
All who fashion idols are nothing and the things they delight in do not profit Their witnesses neither see nor know that they may be put to shame
Who fashions a god or casts an idol that is profitable for nothing
Behold all his companions shall be put to shame and the craftsmen are only human Let them all assemble let them stand forth They shall be terrified they shall be put to shame together
The ironsmith takes a cutting tool and works it over the coals He fashions it with hammers and works it with his strong arm He becomes hungry and his strength fails he drinks no water and is faint
The carpenter stretches a line he marks it out with a pencil He shapes it with planes and marks it with a compass He shapes it into the figure of a man with the beauty of a man to dwell in a house
He cuts down cedars or he chooses a cypress tree or an oak and lets it grow strong among the trees of the forest He plants a cedar and the rain nourishes it
Then it becomes fuel for a man He takes a part of it and warms himself he kindles a fire and bakes bread Also he makes a god and worships it he makes it an idol and falls down before it
Half of it he burns in the fire Over the half he eats meat he roasts it and is satisfied Also he warms himself and says Aha I am warm I have seen the fire
And the rest of it he makes into a god his idol and falls down to it and worships it He prays to it and says Deliver me for you are my god
They know not nor do they discern for he has shut their eyes so that they cannot see and their hearts so that they cannot understand
No one considers nor is there knowledge or discernment to say Half of it I burned in the fire I also baked bread on its coals I roasted meat and have eaten And shall I make the rest of it an abomination Shall I fall down before a block of wood
He feeds on ashes a deluded heart has led him astray and he cannot deliver himself or say Is there not a lie in my right hand
Remember these things O Jacob and Israel for you are my servant I formed you you are my servant O Israel you will not be forgotten by me
I have blotted out your transgressions like a cloud and your sins like mist return to me for I have redeemed you
Sing O heavens for the LORD has done it shout O depths of the earth break forth into singing O mountains O forest and every tree in it For the LORD has redeemed Jacob and will be glorified in Israel
Thus says the LORD your Redeemer who formed you from the womb I am the LORD who made all things who alone stretched out the heavens who spread out the earth by myself
who frustrates the signs of liars and makes fools of diviners who turns wise men back and makes their knowledge foolish
who confirms the word of his servant and fulfills the counsel of his messengers who says of Jerusalem She shall be inhabited and of the cities of Judah They shall be built and I will raise up their ruins
who says to the deep Be dry I will dry up your rivers
who says of Cyrus He is my shepherd and he shall fulfill all my purpose saying of Jerusalem She shall be built and of the temple Your foundation shall be laid
