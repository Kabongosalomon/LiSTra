Acts 23
And looking intently at the council Paul said Brothers I have lived my life before God in all good conscience up to this day
And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth
Then Paul said to him God is going to strike you you whitewashed wall Are you sitting to judge me according to the law and yet contrary to the law you order me to be struck
Those who stood by said Would you revile God s high priest
And Paul said I did not know brothers that he was the high priest for it is written You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people
Now when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees he cried out in the council Brothers I am a Pharisee a son of Pharisees It is with respect to the hope and the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial
And when he had said this a dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the assembly was divided
For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection nor angel nor spirit but the Pharisees acknowledge them all
Then a great clamor arose and some of the scribes of the Pharisees party stood up and contended sharply We find nothing wrong in this man What if a spirit or an angel spoke to him
And when the dissension became violent the tribune afraid that Paul would be torn to pieces by them commanded the soldiers to go down and take him away from among them by force and bring him into the barracks
The following night the Lord stood by him and said Take courage for as you have testified to the facts about me in Jerusalem so you must testify also in Rome
When it was day the Jews made a plot and bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink till they had killed Paul
There were more than forty who made this conspiracy
They went to the chief priests and elders and said We have strictly bound ourselves by an oath to taste no food till we have killed Paul
Now therefore you along with the council give notice to the tribune to bring him down to you as though you were going to determine his case more exactly And we are ready to kill him before he comes near
Now the son of Paul s sister heard of their ambush so he went and entered the barracks and told Paul
Paul called one of the centurions and said Take this young man to the tribune for he has something to tell him
So he took him and brought him to the tribune and said Paul the prisoner called me and asked me to bring this young man to you as he has something to say to you
The tribune took him by the hand and going aside asked him privately What is it that you have to tell me
And he said The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow as though they were going to inquire somewhat more closely about him
But do not be persuaded by them for more than forty of their men are lying in ambush for him who have bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink till they have killed him And now they are ready waiting for your consent
So the tribune dismissed the young man charging him Tell no one that you have informed me of these things
Then he called two of the centurions and said Get ready two hundred soldiers with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go as far as Caesarea at the third hour of the night
Also provide mounts for Paul to ride and bring him safely to Felix the governor
And he wrote a letter to this effect
Claudius Lysias to his Excellency the governor Felix greetings
This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them when I came upon them with the soldiers and rescued him having learned that he was a Roman citizen
And desiring to know the charge for which they were accusing him I brought him down to their council
I found that he was being accused about questions of their law but charged with nothing deserving death or imprisonment
And when it was disclosed to me that there would be a plot against the man I sent him to you at once ordering his accusers also to state before you what they have against him
So the soldiers according to their instructions took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris
And on the next day they returned to the barracks letting the horsemen go on with him
When they had come to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor they presented Paul also before him
On reading the letter he asked what province he was from And when he learned that he was from Cilicia
he said I will give you a hearing when your accusers arrive And he commanded him to be guarded in Herod s praetorium
