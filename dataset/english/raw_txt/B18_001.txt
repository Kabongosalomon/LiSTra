Philemon 1
Paul a prisoner for Christ Jesus and Timothy our brother To Philemon our beloved fellow worker
and Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier and the church in your house
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers
because I hear of your love and of the faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and for all the saints
and I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective for the full knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ
For I have derived much joy and comfort from your love my brother because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you
Accordingly though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required
yet for love s sake I prefer to appeal to you I Paul an old man and now a prisoner also for Christ Jesus
I appeal to you for my child Onesimus whose father I became in my imprisonment
Formerly he was useless to you but now he is indeed useful to you and to me
I am sending him back to you sending my very heart
I would have been glad to keep him with me in order that he might serve me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel
but I preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your goodness might not be by compulsion but of your own accord
For this perhaps is why he was parted from you for a while that you might have him back forever
no longer as a slave but more than a slave as a beloved brother especially to me but how much more to you both in the flesh and in the Lord
So if you consider me your partner receive him as you would receive me
If he has wronged you at all or owes you anything charge that to my account
I Paul write this with my own hand I will repay it to say nothing of your owing me even your own self
Yes brother I want some benefit from you in the Lord Refresh my heart in Christ
Confident of your obedience I write to you knowing that you will do even more than I say
At the same time prepare a guest room for me for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be graciously given to you
Epaphras my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus sends greetings to you
and so do Mark Aristarchus Demas and Luke my fellow workers
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit
