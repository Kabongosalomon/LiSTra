Isaiah 16
Send the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela by way of the desert to the mount of the daughter of Zion
Like fleeing birds like a scattered nest so are the daughters of Moab at the fords of the Arnon
Give counsel grant justice make your shade like night at the height of noon shelter the outcasts do not reveal the fugitive
let the outcasts of Moab sojourn among you be a shelter to them from the destroyer When the oppressor is no more and destruction has ceased and he who tramples underfoot has vanished from the land
then a throne will be established in steadfast love and on it will sit in faithfulness in the tent of David one who judges and seeks justice and is swift to do righteousness
We have heard of the pride of Moab how proud he is of his arrogance his pride and his insolence in his idle boasting he is not right
Therefore let Moab wail for Moab let everyone wail Mourn utterly stricken for the raisin cakes of Kir hareseth
For the fields of Heshbon languish and the vine of Sibmah the lords of the nations have struck down its branches which reached to Jazer and strayed to the desert its shoots spread abroad and passed over the sea
Therefore I weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sibmah I drench you with my tears O Heshbon and Elealeh for over your summer fruit and your harvest the shout has ceased
And joy and gladness are taken away from the fruitful field and in the vineyards no songs are sung no cheers are raised no treader treads out wine in the presses I have put an end to the shouting
Therefore my inner parts moan like a lyre for Moab and my inmost self for Kir hareseth
And when Moab presents himself when he wearies himself on the high place when he comes to his sanctuary to pray he will not prevail
This is the word that the LORD spoke concerning Moab in the past
But now the LORD has spoken saying In three years like the years of a hired worker the glory of Moab will be brought into contempt in spite of all his great multitude and those who remain will be very few and feeble
