Isaiah 43
But now thus says the LORD he who created you O Jacob he who formed you O Israel Fear not for I have redeemed you I have called you by name you are mine
When you pass through the waters I will be with you and through the rivers they shall not overwhelm you when you walk through fire you shall not be burned and the flame shall not consume you
For I am the LORD your God the Holy One of Israel your Savior I give Egypt as your ransom Cush and Seba in exchange for you
Because you are precious in my eyes and honored and I love you I give men in return for you peoples in exchange for your life
Fear not for I am with you I will bring your offspring from the east and from the west I will gather you
I will say to the north Give up and to the south Do not withhold bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the end of the earth
everyone who is called by my name whom I created for my glory whom I formed and made
Bring out the people who are blind yet have eyes who are deaf yet have ears
All the nations gather together and the peoples assemble Who among them can declare this and show us the former things Let them bring their witnesses to prove them right and let them hear and say It is true
You are my witnesses declares the LORD and my servant whom I have chosen that you may know and believe me and understand that I am he Before me no god was formed nor shall there be any after me
I I am the LORD and besides me there is no savior
I declared and saved and proclaimed when there was no strange god among you and you are my witnesses declares the LORD and I am God
Also henceforth I am he there is none who can deliver from my hand I work and who can turn it back
Thus says the LORD your Redeemer the Holy One of Israel For your sake I send to Babylon and bring them all down as fugitives even the Chaldeans in the ships in which they rejoice
I am the LORD your Holy One the Creator of Israel your King
Thus says the LORD who makes a way in the sea a path in the mighty waters
who brings forth chariot and horse army and warrior they lie down they cannot rise they are extinguished quenched like a wick
Remember not the former things nor consider the things of old
Behold I am doing a new thing now it springs forth do you not perceive it I will make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert
The wild beasts will honor me the jackals and the ostriches for I give water in the wilderness rivers in the desert to give drink to my chosen people
the people whom I formed for myself that they might declare my praise
Yet you did not call upon me O Jacob but you have been weary of me O Israel
You have not brought me your sheep for burnt offerings or honored me with your sacrifices I have not burdened you with offerings or wearied you with frankincense
You have not bought me sweet cane with money or satisfied me with the fat of your sacrifices But you have burdened me with your sins you have wearied me with your iniquities
I I am he who blots out your transgressions for my own sake and I will not remember your sins
Put me in remembrance let us argue together set forth your case that you may be proved right
Your first father sinned and your mediators transgressed against me
Therefore I will profane the princes of the sanctuary and deliver Jacob to utter destruction and Israel to reviling
