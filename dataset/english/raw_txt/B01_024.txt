Matthew 24
Jesus left the temple and was going away when his disciples came to point out to him the buildings of the temple
But he answered them You see all these do you not Truly I say to you there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down
As he sat on the Mount of Olives the disciples came to him privately saying Tell us when will these things be and what will be the sign of your coming and of the close of the age
And Jesus answered them See that no one leads you astray
For many will come in my name saying I am the Christ and they will lead many astray
And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars See that you are not alarmed for this must take place but the end is not yet
For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places
All these are but the beginning of the birth pains
Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death and you will be hated by all nations for my name s sake
And then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another
And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray
And because lawlessness will be increased the love of many will grow cold
But the one who endures to the end will be saved
And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations and then the end will come
So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel standing in the holy place let the reader understand
then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains
Let the one who is on the housetop not go down to take what is in his house
and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak
And alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days
Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath
For then there will be great tribulation such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now no and never will be
And if those days had not been cut short no human being would be saved But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short
Then if anyone says to you Look here is the Christ or There he is do not believe it
For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders so as to lead astray if possible even the elect
See I have told you beforehand
So if they say to you Look he is in the wilderness do not go out If they say Look he is in the inner rooms do not believe it
For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west so will be the coming of the Son of Man
Wherever the corpse is there the vultures will gather
Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light and the stars will fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens will be shaken
Then will appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory
And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call and they will gather his elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other
From the fig tree learn its lesson as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves you know that summer is near
So also when you see all these things you know that he is near at the very gates
Truly I say to you this generation will not pass away until all these things take place
Heaven and earth will pass away but my words will not pass away
But concerning that day and hour no one knows not even the angels of heaven nor the Son but the Father only
For as were the days of Noah so will be the coming of the Son of Man
For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day when Noah entered the ark
and they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away so will be the coming of the Son of Man
Then two men will be in the field one will be taken and one left
Two women will be grinding at the mill one will be taken and one left
Therefore stay awake for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming
But know this that if the master of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into
Therefore you also must be ready for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect
Who then is the faithful and wise servant whom his master has set over his household to give them their food at the proper time
Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes
Truly I say to you he will set him over all his possessions
But if that wicked servant says to himself My master is delayed
and begins to beat his fellow servants and eats and drinks with drunkards
the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know
and will cut him in pieces and put him with the hypocrites In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
