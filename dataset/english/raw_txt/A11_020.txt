1 Kings 20
Ben hadad the king of Syria gathered all his army together Thirty two kings were with him and horses and chariots And he went up and closed in on Samaria and fought against it
And he sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel and said to him Thus says Ben hadad
Your silver and your gold are mine your best wives and children also are mine
And the king of Israel answered As you say my lord O king I am yours and all that I have
The messengers came again and said Thus says Ben hadad I sent to you saying Deliver to me your silver and your gold your wives and your children
Nevertheless I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time and they shall search your house and the houses of your servants and lay hands on whatever pleases you and take it away
Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land and said Mark now and see how this man is seeking trouble for he sent to me for my wives and my children and for my silver and my gold and I did not refuse him
And all the elders and all the people said to him Do not listen or consent
So he said to the messengers of Ben hadad Tell my lord the king All that you first demanded of your servant I will do but this thing I cannot do And the messengers departed and brought him word again
Ben hadad sent to him and said The gods do so to me and more also if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people who follow me
And the king of Israel answered Tell him Let not him who straps on his armor boast himself as he who takes it off
When Ben hadad heard this message as he was drinking with the kings in the booths he said to his men Take your positions And they took their positions against the city
And behold a prophet came near to Ahab king of Israel and said Thus says the LORD Have you seen all this great multitude Behold I will give it into your hand this day and you shall know that I am the LORD
And Ahab said By whom He said Thus says the LORD By the servants of the governors of the districts Then he said Who shall begin the battle He answered You
Then he mustered the servants of the governors of the districts and they were And after them he mustered all the people of Israel seven thousand
And they went out at noon while Ben hadad was drinking himself drunk in the booths he and the thirty two kings who helped him
The servants of the governors of the districts went out first And Ben hadad sent out scouts and they reported to him Men are coming out from Samaria
He said If they have come out for peace take them alive Or if they have come out for war take them alive
So these went out of the city the servants of the governors of the districts and the army that followed them
And each struck down his man The Syrians fled and Israel pursued them but Ben hadad king of Syria escaped on a horse with horsemen
And the king of Israel went out and struck the horses and chariots and struck the Syrians with a great blow
Then the prophet came near to the king of Israel and said to him Come strengthen yourself and consider well what you have to do for in the spring the king of Syria will come up against you
And the servants of the king of Syria said to him Their gods are gods of the hills and so they were stronger than we But let us fight against them in the plain and surely we shall be stronger than they
And do this remove the kings each from his post and put commanders in their places
and muster an army like the army that you have lost horse for horse and chariot for chariot Then we will fight against them in the plain and surely we shall be stronger than they And he listened to their voice and did so
In the spring Ben hadad mustered the Syrians and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel
And the people of Israel were mustered and were provisioned and went against them The people of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of goats but the Syrians filled the country
And a man of God came near and said to the king of Israel Thus says the LORD Because the Syrians have said The LORD is a god of the hills but he is not a god of the valleys therefore I will give all this great multitude into your hand and you shall know that I am the LORD
And they encamped opposite one another seven days Then on the seventh day the battle was joined And the people of Israel struck down of the Syrians foot soldiers in one day
And the rest fled into the city of Aphek and the wall fell upon men who were left Ben hadad also fled and entered an inner chamber in the city
And his servants said to him Behold now we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings Let us put sackcloth around our waists and ropes on our heads and go out to the king of Israel Perhaps he will spare your life
So they tied sackcloth around their waists and put ropes on their heads and went to the king of Israel and said Your servant Ben hadad says Please let me live And he said Does he still live He is my brother
Now the men were watching for a sign and they quickly took it up from him and said Yes your brother Ben hadad Then he said Go and bring him Then Ben hadad came out to him and he caused him to come up into the chariot
And Ben hadad said to him The cities that my father took from your father I will restore and you may establish bazaars for yourself in Damascus as my father did in Samaria And Ahab said I will let you go on these terms So he made a covenant with him and let him go
And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his fellow at the command of the LORD Strike me please But the man refused to strike him
Then he said to him Because you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD behold as soon as you have gone from me a lion shall strike you down And as soon as he had departed from him a lion met him and struck him down
Then he found another man and said Strike me please And the man struck him struck him and wounded him
So the prophet departed and waited for the king by the way disguising himself with a bandage over his eyes
And as the king passed he cried to the king and said Your servant went out into the midst of the battle and behold a soldier turned and brought a man to me and said Guard this man if by any means he is missing your life shall be for his life or else you shall pay a talent of silver
And as your servant was busy here and there he was gone The king of Israel said to him So shall your judgment be you yourself have decided it
Then he hurried to take the bandage away from his eyes and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets
And he said to him Thus says the LORD Because you have let go out of your hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction therefore your life shall be for his life and your people for his people
And the king of Israel went to his house vexed and sullen and came to Samaria
