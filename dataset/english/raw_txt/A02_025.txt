And let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell in their midst
Exactly as I show you concerning the pattern of the tabernacle and of all its furniture so you shall make it
They shall make an ark of acacia wood Two cubits and a half shall be its length a cubit and a half its breadth and a cubit and a half its height
