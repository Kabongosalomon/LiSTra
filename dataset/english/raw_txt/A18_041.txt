Job 41
Can you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook or press down his tongue with a cord
Can you put a rope in his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook
Will he make many pleas to you Will he speak to you soft words
Will he make a covenant with you to take him for your servant forever
Will you play with him as with a bird or will you put him on a leash for your girls
Will traders bargain over him Will they divide him up among the merchants
Can you fill his skin with harpoons or his head with fishing spears
Lay your hands on him remember the battle you will not do it again
Behold the hope of a man is false he is laid low even at the sight of him
No one is so fierce that he dares to stir him up Who then is he who can stand before me
Who has first given to me that I should repay him Whatever is under the whole heaven is mine
I will not keep silence concerning his limbs or his mighty strength or his goodly frame
Who can strip off his outer garment Who would come near him with a bridle
Who can open the doors of his face Around his teeth is terror
His back is made of rows of shields shut up closely as with a seal
One is so near to another that no air can come between them
They are joined one to another they clasp each other and cannot be separated
His sneezings flash forth light and his eyes are like the eyelids of the dawn
Out of his mouth go flaming torches sparks of fire leap forth
Out of his nostrils comes forth smoke as from a boiling pot and burning rushes
His breath kindles coals and a flame comes forth from his mouth
In his neck abides strength and terror dances before him
The folds of his flesh stick together firmly cast on him and immovable
His heart is hard as a stone hard as the lower millstone
When he raises himself up the mighty are afraid at the crashing they are beside themselves
Though the sword reaches him it does not avail nor the spear the dart or the javelin
He counts iron as straw and bronze as rotten wood
The arrow cannot make him flee for him sling stones are turned to stubble
Clubs are counted as stubble he laughs at the rattle of javelins
His underparts are like sharp potsherds he spreads himself like a threshing sledge on the mire
He makes the deep boil like a pot he makes the sea like a pot of ointment
Behind him he leaves a shining wake one would think the deep to be white haired
On earth there is not his like a creature without fear
He sees everything that is high he is king over all the sons of pride
