Luke 5
On one occasion while the crowd was pressing in on him to hear the word of God he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret
and he saw two boats by the lake but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets
Getting into one of the boats which was Simon s he asked him to put out a little from the land And he sat down and taught the people from the boat
And when he had finished speaking he said to Simon Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch
And Simon answered Master we toiled all night and took nothing But at your word I will let down the nets
And when they had done this they enclosed a large number of fish and their nets were breaking
They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them And they came and filled both the boats so that they began to sink
But when Simon Peter saw it he fell down at Jesus knees saying Depart from me for I am a sinful man O Lord
For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish that they had taken
and so also were James and John sons of Zebedee who were partners with Simon And Jesus said to Simon Do not be afraid from now on you will be catching men
And when they had brought their boats to land they left everything and followed him
While he was in one of the cities there came a man full of leprosy And when he saw Jesus he fell on his face and begged him Lord if you will you can make me clean
And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him saying I will be clean And immediately the leprosy left him
And he charged him to tell no one but go and show yourself to the priest and make an offering for your cleansing as Moses commanded for a proof to them
But now even more the report about him went abroad and great crowds gathered to hear him and to be healed of their infirmities
But he would withdraw to desolate places and pray
On one of those days as he was teaching Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem And the power of the Lord was with him to heal
And behold some men were bringing on a bed a man who was paralyzed and they were seeking to bring him in and lay him before Jesus
but finding no way to bring him in because of the crowd they went up on the roof and let him down with his bed through the tiles into the midst before Jesus
And when he saw their faith he said Man your sins are forgiven you
And the scribes and the Pharisees began to question saying Who is this who speaks blasphemies Who can forgive sins but God alone
When Jesus perceived their thoughts he answered them Why do you question in your hearts
Which is easier to say Your sins are forgiven you or to say Rise and walk
But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins he said to the man who was paralyzed I say to you rise pick up your bed and go home
And immediately he rose up before them and picked up what he had been lying on and went home glorifying God
And amazement seized them all and they glorified God and were filled with awe saying We have seen extraordinary things today
After this he went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax booth And he said to him Follow me
And leaving everything he rose and followed him
And Levi made him a great feast in his house and there was a large company of tax collectors and others reclining at table with them
And the Pharisees and their scribes grumbled at his disciples saying Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners
And Jesus answered them Those who are well have no need of a physician but those who are sick
I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance
And they said to him The disciples of John fast often and offer prayers and so do the disciples of the Pharisees but yours eat and drink
And Jesus said to them Can you make wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them
The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them and then they will fast in those days
He also told them a parable No one tears a piece from a new garment and puts it on an old garment If he does he will tear the new and the piece from the new will not match the old
And no one puts new wine into old wineskins If he does the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled and the skins will be destroyed
But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins
And no one after drinking old wine desires new for he says The old is good
