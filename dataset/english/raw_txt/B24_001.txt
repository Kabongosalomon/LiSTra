2 John 1
The elder to the elect lady and her children whom I love in truth and not only I but also all who know the truth
because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever
Grace mercy and peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Father s Son in truth and love
I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children walking in the truth just as we were commanded by the Father
And now I ask you dear lady not as though I were writing you a new commandment but the one we have had from the beginning that we love one another
And this is love that we walk according to his commandments this is the commandment just as you have heard from the beginning so that you should walk in it
For many deceivers have gone out into the world those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh Such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist
Watch yourselves so that you may not lose what we have worked for but may win a full reward
Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ does not have God Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son
If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching do not receive him into your house or give him any greeting
for whoever greets him takes part in his wicked works
Though I have much to write to you I would rather not use paper and ink Instead I hope to come to you and talk face to face so that our joy may be complete
The children of your elect sister greet you
