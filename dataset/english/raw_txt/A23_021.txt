Isaiah 21
The oracle concerning the wilderness of the sea As whirlwinds in the Negeb sweep on it comes from the wilderness from a terrible land
A stern vision is told to me the traitor betrays and the destroyer destroys Go up O Elam lay siege O Media all the sighing she has caused I bring to an end
Therefore my loins are filled with anguish pangs have seized me like the pangs of a woman in labor I am bowed down so that I cannot hear I am dismayed so that I cannot see
My heart staggers horror has appalled me the twilight I longed for has been turned for me into trembling
They prepare the table they spread the rugs they eat they drink Arise O princes oil the shield
For thus the Lord said to me Go set a watchman let him announce what he sees
When he sees riders horsemen in pairs riders on donkeys riders on camels let him listen diligently very diligently
Then he who saw cried out Upon a watchtower I stand O Lord continually by day and at my post I am stationed whole nights
And behold here come riders horsemen in pairs And he answered Fallen fallen is Babylon and all the carved images of her gods he has shattered to the ground
O my threshed and winnowed one what I have heard from the LORD of hosts the God of Israel I announce to you
The oracle concerning Dumah One is calling to me from Seir Watchman what time of the night Watchman what time of the night
The watchman says Morning comes and also the night If you will inquire inquire come back again
The oracle concerning Arabia In the thickets in Arabia you will lodge O caravans of Dedanites
To the thirsty bring water meet the fugitive with bread O inhabitants of the land of Tema
For they have fled from the swords from the drawn sword from the bent bow and from the press of battle
For thus the Lord said to me Within a year according to the years of a hired worker all the glory of Kedar will come to an end
And the remainder of the archers of the mighty men of the sons of Kedar will be few for the LORD the God of Israel has spoken
