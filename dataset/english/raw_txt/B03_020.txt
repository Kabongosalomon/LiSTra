Luke 20
One day as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel the chief priests and the scribes with the elders came up
and said to him Tell us by what authority you do these things or who it is that gave you this authority
He answered them I also will ask you a question Now tell me
was the baptism of John from heaven or from man
And they discussed it with one another saying If we say From heaven he will say Why did you not believe him
But if we say From man all the people will stone us to death for they are convinced that John was a prophet
So they answered that they did not know where it came from
And Jesus said to them Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things
And he began to tell the people this parable A man planted a vineyard and let it out to tenants and went into another country for a long while
When the time came he sent a servant to the tenants so that they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty handed
And he sent another servant But they also beat and treated him shamefully and sent him away empty handed
And he sent yet a third This one also they wounded and cast out
Then the owner of the vineyard said What shall I do I will send my beloved son perhaps they will respect him
But when the tenants saw him they said to themselves This is the heir Let us kill him so that the inheritance may be ours
And they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them
He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others When they heard this they said Surely not
But he looked directly at them and said What then is this that is written The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone
Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces and when it falls on anyone it will crush him
The scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him at that very hour for they perceived that he had told this parable against them but they feared the people
So they watched him and sent spies who pretended to be sincere that they might catch him in something he said so as to deliver him up to the authority and jurisdiction of the governor
So they asked him Teacher we know that you speak and teach rightly and show no partiality but truly teach the way of God
Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar or not
But he perceived their craftiness and said to them
Show me a denarius Whose likeness and inscription does it have They said Caesar s
He said to them Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar s and to God the things that are God s
And they were not able in the presence of the people to catch him in what he said but marveling at his answer they became silent
There came to him some Sadducees those who deny that there is a resurrection
and they asked him a question saying Teacher Moses wrote for us that if a man s brother dies having a wife but no children the man must take the widow and raise up offspring for his brother
Now there were seven brothers The first took a wife and died without children
And the second
and the third took her and likewise all seven left no children and died
Afterward the woman also died
In the resurrection therefore whose wife will the woman be For the seven had her as wife
And Jesus said to them The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage
but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage
for they cannot die anymore because they are equal to angels and are sons of God being sons of the resurrection
But that the dead are raised even Moses showed in the passage about the bush where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob
Now he is not God of the dead but of the living for all live to him
Then some of the scribes answered Teacher you have spoken well
For they no longer dared to ask him any question
But he said to them How can they say that the Christ is David s son
For David himself says in the Book of Psalms The Lord said to my Lord Sit at my right hand
until I make your enemies your footstool
David thus calls him Lord so how is he his son
And in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples
Beware of the scribes who like to walk around in long robes and love greetings in the marketplaces and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts
who devour widows houses and for a pretense make long prayers They will receive the greater condemnation
