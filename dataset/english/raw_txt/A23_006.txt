Isaiah 6
In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and the train of his robe filled the temple
Above him stood the seraphim Each had six wings with two he covered his face and with two he covered his feet and with two he flew
And one called to another and said Holy holy holy is the LORD of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory
And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called and the house was filled with smoke
And I said Woe is me For I am lost for I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for my eyes have seen the King the LORD of hosts
Then one of the seraphim flew to me having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar
And he touched my mouth and said Behold this has touched your lips your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for
And I heard the voice of the Lord saying Whom shall I send and who will go for us Then I said Here am I Send me
And he said Go and say to this people Keep on hearing but do not understand keep on seeing but do not perceive
Make the heart of this people dull and their ears heavy and blind their eyes lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their hearts and turn and be healed
Then I said How long O Lord And he said Until cities lie waste without inhabitant and houses without people and the land is a desolate waste
and the LORD removes people far away and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land
And though a tenth remain in it it will be burned again like a terebinth or an oak whose stump remains when it is felled The holy seed is its stump
