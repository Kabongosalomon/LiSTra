Titus 3
Remind them to be submissive to rulers and authorities to be obedient to be ready for every good work
to speak evil of no one to avoid quarreling to be gentle and to show perfect courtesy toward all people
For we ourselves were once foolish disobedient led astray slaves to various passions and pleasures passing our days in malice and envy hated by others and hating one another
But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared
he saved us not because of works done by us in righteousness but according to his own mercy by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit
whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior
so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life
The saying is trustworthy and I want you to insist on these things so that those who have believed in God may be careful to devote themselves to good works These things are excellent and profitable for people
But avoid foolish controversies genealogies dissensions and quarrels about the law for they are unprofitable and worthless
As for a person who stirs up division after warning him once and then twice have nothing more to do with him
knowing that such a person is warped and sinful he is self condemned
When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you do your best to come to me at Nicopolis for I have decided to spend the winter there
Do your best to speed Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way see that they lack nothing
And let our people learn to devote themselves to good works so as to help cases of urgent need and not be unfruitful
All who are with me send greetings to you Greet those who love us in the faith Grace be with you all
