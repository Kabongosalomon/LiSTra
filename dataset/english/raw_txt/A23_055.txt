Isaiah 55
Come everyone who thirsts come to the waters and he who has no money come buy and eat Come buy wine and milk without money and without price
Why do you spend your money for that which is not bread and your labor for that which does not satisfy Listen diligently to me and eat what is good and delight yourselves in rich food
Incline your ear and come to me hear that your soul may live and I will make with you an everlasting covenant my steadfast sure love for David
Behold I made him a witness to the peoples a leader and commander for the peoples
Behold you shall call a nation that you do not know and a nation that did not know you shall run to you because of the LORD your God and of the Holy One of Israel for he has glorified you
Seek the LORD while he may be found call upon him while he is near
let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts let him return to the LORD that he may have compassion on him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon
For my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways declares the LORD
For as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven and do not return there but water the earth making it bring forth and sprout giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater
so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth it shall not return to me empty but it shall accomplish that which I purpose and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it
For you shall go out in joy and be led forth in peace the mountains and the hills before you shall break forth into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands
Instead of the thorn shall come up the cypress instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle and it shall make a name for the LORD an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off
