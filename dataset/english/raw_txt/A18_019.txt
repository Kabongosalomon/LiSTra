Job 19
Then Job answered and said
How long will you torment me and break me in pieces with words
These ten times you have cast reproach upon me are you not ashamed to wrong me
And even if it be true that I have erred my error remains with myself
If indeed you magnify yourselves against me and make my disgrace an argument against me
know then that God has put me in the wrong and closed his net about me
Behold I cry out Violence but I am not answered I call for help but there is no justice
He has walled up my way so that I cannot pass and he has set darkness upon my paths
He has stripped from me my glory and taken the crown from my head
He breaks me down on every side and I am gone and my hope has he pulled up like a tree
He has kindled his wrath against me and counts me as his adversary
His troops come on together they have cast up their siege ramp against me and encamp around my tent
He has put my brothers far from me and those who knew me are wholly estranged from me
My relatives have failed me my close friends have forgotten me
The guests in my house and my maidservants count me as a stranger I have become a foreigner in their eyes
I call to my servant but he gives me no answer I must plead with him with my mouth for mercy
My breath is strange to my wife and I am a stench to the children of my own mother
Even young children despise me when I rise they talk against me
All my intimate friends abhor me and those whom I loved have turned against me
My bones stick to my skin and to my flesh and I have escaped by the skin of my teeth
Have mercy on me have mercy on me O you my friends for the hand of God has touched me
Why do you like God pursue me Why are you not satisfied with my flesh
Oh that my words were written Oh that they were inscribed in a book
Oh that with an iron pen and lead they were engraved in the rock forever
For I know that my Redeemer lives and at the last he will stand upon the earth
And after my skin has been thus destroyed yet in my flesh I shall see God
whom I shall see for myself and my eyes shall behold and not another My heart faints within me
If you say How we will pursue him and The root of the matter is found in him
be afraid of the sword for wrath brings the punishment of the sword that you may know there is a judgment
