Zechariah 5
Again I lifted my eyes and saw and behold a flying scroll
And he said to me What do you see I answered I see a flying scroll Its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits
Then he said to me This is the curse that goes out over the face of the whole land For everyone who steals shall be cleaned out according to what is on one side and everyone who swears falsely shall be cleaned out according to what is on the other side
I will send it out declares the LORD of hosts and it shall enter the house of the thief and the house of him who swears falsely by my name And it shall remain in his house and consume it both timber and stones
Then the angel who talked with me came forward and said to me Lift your eyes and see what this is that is going out
And I said What is it He said This is the basket that is going out And he said This is their iniquity in all the land
And behold the leaden cover was lifted and there was a woman sitting in the basket
And he said This is Wickedness And he thrust her back into the basket and thrust down the leaden weight on its opening
Then I lifted my eyes and saw and behold two women coming forward The wind was in their wings They had wings like the wings of a stork and they lifted up the basket between earth and heaven
Then I said to the angel who talked with me Where are they taking the basket
He said to me To the land of Shinar to build a house for it And when this is prepared they will set the basket down there on its base
