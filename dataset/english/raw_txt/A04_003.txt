Numbers 3
These are the generations of Aaron and Moses at the time when the LORD spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai
These are the names of the sons of Aaron Nadab the firstborn and Abihu Eleazar and Ithamar
These are the names of the sons of Aaron the anointed priests whom he ordained to serve as priests
But Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD when they offered unauthorized fire before the LORD in the wilderness of Sinai and they had no children So Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests in the lifetime of Aaron their father
And the LORD spoke to Moses saying
Bring the tribe of Levi near and set them before Aaron the priest that they may minister to him
They shall keep guard over him and over the whole congregation before the tent of meeting as they minister at the tabernacle
They shall guard all the furnishings of the tent of meeting and keep guard over the people of Israel as they minister at the tabernacle
And you shall give the Levites to Aaron and his sons they are wholly given to him from among the people of Israel
And you shall appoint Aaron and his sons and they shall guard their priesthood But if any outsider comes near he shall be put to death
And the LORD spoke to Moses saying
Behold I have taken the Levites from among the people of Israel instead of every firstborn who opens the womb among the people of Israel The Levites shall be mine
for all the firstborn are mine On the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I consecrated for my own all the firstborn in Israel both of man and of beast They shall be mine I am the LORD
And the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai saying
List the sons of Levi by fathers houses and by clans every male from a month old and upward you shall list
So Moses listed them according to the word of the LORD as he was commanded
And these were the sons of Levi by their names Gershon and Kohath and Merari
And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their clans Libni and Shimei
And the sons of Kohath by their clans Amram Izhar Hebron and Uzziel
And the sons of Merari by their clans Mahli and Mushi These are the clans of the Levites by their fathers houses

According to the number of all the males from a month old and upward there were keeping guard over the sanctuary
The clans of the sons of Kohath were to camp on the south side of the tabernacle

also the pillars around the court with their bases and pegs and cords
Those who were to camp before the tabernacle on the east before the tent of meeting toward the sunrise were Moses and Aaron and his sons guarding the sanctuary itself to protect the people of Israel And any outsider who came near was to be put to death
All those listed among the Levites whom Moses and Aaron listed at the commandment of the LORD by clans all the males from a month old and upward were
And the LORD said to Moses List all the firstborn males of the people of Israel from a month old and upward taking the number of their names
And you shall take the Levites for me I am the LORD instead of all the firstborn among the people of Israel and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the cattle of the people of Israel
So Moses listed all the firstborn among the people of Israel as the LORD commanded him
And all the firstborn males according to the number of names from a month old and upward as listed were
And the LORD spoke to Moses saying
Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the people of Israel and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle The Levites shall be mine I am the LORD
And as the redemption price for the of the firstborn of the people of Israel over and above the number of the male Levites
you shall take five shekels per head you shall take them according to the shekel of the sanctuary the shekel of twenty gerahs
and give the money to Aaron and his sons as the redemption price for those who are over
So Moses took the redemption money from those who were over and above those redeemed by the Levites
From the firstborn of the people of Israel he took the money shekels by the shekel of the sanctuary
And Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and his sons according to the word of the LORD as the LORD commanded Moses
