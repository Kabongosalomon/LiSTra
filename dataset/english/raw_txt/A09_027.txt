1 Samuel 27
Then David said in his heart Now I shall perish one day by the hand of Saul There is nothing better for me than that I should escape to the land of the Philistines Then Saul will despair of seeking me any longer within the borders of Israel and I shall escape out of his hand
So David arose and went over he and the six hundred men who were with him to Achish the son of Maoch king of Gath
And David lived with Achish at Gath he and his men every man with his household and David with his two wives Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of Carmel Nabal s widow
And when it was told Saul that David had fled to Gath he no longer sought him
Then David said to Achish If I have found favor in your eyes let a place be given me in one of the country towns that I may dwell there For why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you
So that day Achish gave him Ziklag Therefore Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah to this day
And the number of the days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was a year and four months
Now David and his men went up and made raids against the Geshurites the Girzites and the Amalekites for these were the inhabitants of the land from of old as far as Shur to the land of Egypt
And David would strike the land and would leave neither man nor woman alive but would take away the sheep the oxen the donkeys the camels and the garments and come back to Achish
When Achish asked Where have you made a raid today David would say Against the Negeb of Judah or Against the Negeb of the Jerahmeelites or Against the Negeb of the Kenites
And David would leave neither man nor woman alive to bring news to Gath thinking lest they should tell about us and say So David has done Such was his custom all the while he lived in the country of the Philistines
And Achish trusted David thinking He has made himself an utter stench to his people Israel therefore he shall always be my servant
