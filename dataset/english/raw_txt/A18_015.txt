Job 15
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said
Should a wise man answer with windy knowledge and fill his belly with the east wind
Should he argue in unprofitable talk or in words with which he can do no good
But you are doing away with the fear of God and hindering meditation before God
For your iniquity teaches your mouth and you choose the tongue of the crafty
Your own mouth condemns you and not I your own lips testify against you
Are you the first man who was born Or were you brought forth before the hills
Have you listened in the council of God And do you limit wisdom to yourself
What do you know that we do not know What do you understand that is not clear to us
Both the gray haired and the aged are among us older than your father
Are the comforts of God too small for you or the word that deals gently with you
Why does your heart carry you away and why do your eyes flash
that you turn your spirit against God and bring such words out of your mouth
What is man that he can be pure Or he who is born of a woman that he can be righteous
Behold God puts no trust in his holy ones and the heavens are not pure in his sight
how much less one who is abominable and corrupt a man who drinks injustice like water
I will show you hear me and what I have seen I will declare
what wise men have told without hiding it from their fathers
to whom alone the land was given and no stranger passed among them
The wicked man writhes in pain all his days through all the years that are laid up for the ruthless
Dreadful sounds are in his ears in prosperity the destroyer will come upon him
He does not believe that he will return out of darkness and he is marked for the sword
He wanders abroad for bread saying Where is it He knows that a day of darkness is ready at his hand
distress and anguish terrify him they prevail against him like a king ready for battle
Because he has stretched out his hand against God and defies the Almighty
running stubbornly against him with a thickly bossed shield
because he has covered his face with his fat and gathered fat upon his waist
and has lived in desolate cities in houses that none should inhabit which were ready to become heaps of ruins
he will not be rich and his wealth will not endure nor will his possessions spread over the earth
he will not depart from darkness the flame will dry up his shoots and by the breath of his mouth he will depart
Let him not trust in emptiness deceiving himself for emptiness will be his payment
It will be paid in full before his time and his branch will not be green
He will shake off his unripe grape like the vine and cast off his blossom like the olive tree
For the company of the godless is barren and fire consumes the tents of bribery
They conceive trouble and give birth to evil and their womb prepares deceit
