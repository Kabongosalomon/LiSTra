1 Samuel 14
One day Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who carried his armor Come let us go over to the Philistine garrison on the other side But he did not tell his father
Saul was staying in the outskirts of Gibeah in the pomegranate cave at Migron The people who were with him were about six hundred men
including Ahijah the son of Ahitub Ichabod s brother son of Phinehas son of Eli the priest of the LORD in Shiloh wearing an ephod And the people did not know that Jonathan had gone
Within the passes by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistine garrison there was a rocky crag on the one side and a rocky crag on the other side The name of the one was Bozez and the name of the other Seneh
The one crag rose on the north in front of Michmash and the other on the south in front of Geba
Jonathan said to the young man who carried his armor Come let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised It may be that the LORD will work for us for nothing can hinder the LORD from saving by many or by few
And his armor bearer said to him Do all that is in your heart Do as you wish Behold I am with you heart and soul
Then Jonathan said Behold we will cross over to the men and we will show ourselves to them
If they say to us Wait until we come to you then we will stand still in our place and we will not go up to them
But if they say Come up to us then we will go up for the LORD has given them into our hand And this shall be the sign to us
So both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines And the Philistines said Look Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hidden themselves
And the men of the garrison hailed Jonathan and his armor bearer and said Come up to us and we will show you a thing And Jonathan said to his armor bearer Come up after me for the LORD has given them into the hand of Israel
Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet and his armor bearer after him And they fell before Jonathan and his armor bearer killed them after him
And that first strike which Jonathan and his armor bearer made killed about twenty men within as it were half a furrow s length in an acre of land
And there was a panic in the camp in the field and among all the people The garrison and even the raiders trembled the earth quaked and it became a very great panic
And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked and behold the multitude was dispersing here and there
Then Saul said to the people who were with him Count and see who has gone from us And when they had counted behold Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there
So Saul said to Ahijah Bring the ark of God here For the ark of God went at that time with the people of Israel
Now while Saul was talking to the priest the tumult in the camp of the Philistines increased more and more So Saul said to the priest Withdraw your hand
Then Saul and all the people who were with him rallied and went into the battle And behold every Philistine s sword was against his fellow and there was very great confusion
Now the Hebrews who had been with the Philistines before that time and who had gone up with them into the camp even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan
Likewise when all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing they too followed hard after them in the battle
So the LORD saved Israel that day And the battle passed beyond Beth aven
And the men of Israel had been hard pressed that day so Saul had laid an oath on the people saying Cursed be the man who eats food until it is evening and I am avenged on my enemies So none of the people had tasted food
Now when all the people came to the forest behold there was honey on the ground
And when the people entered the forest behold the honey was dropping but no one put his hand to his mouth for the people feared the oath
But Jonathan had not heard his father charge the people with the oath so he put out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth and his eyes became bright
Then one of the people said Your father strictly charged the people with an oath saying Cursed be the man who eats food this day And the people were faint
Then Jonathan said My father has troubled the land See how my eyes have become bright because I tasted a little of this honey
How much better if the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies that they found For now the defeat among the Philistines has not been great
They struck down the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon And the people were very faint
The people pounced on the spoil and took sheep and oxen and calves and slaughtered them on the ground And the people ate them with the blood
Then they told Saul Behold the people are sinning against the LORD by eating with the blood And he said You have dealt treacherously roll a great stone to me here
And Saul said Disperse yourselves among the people and say to them Let every man bring his ox or his sheep and slaughter them here and eat and do not sin against the LORD by eating with the blood So every one of the people brought his ox with him that night and they slaughtered them there
And Saul built an altar to the LORD it was the first altar that he built to the LORD
Then Saul said Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them until the morning light let us not leave a man of them And they said Do whatever seems good to you But the priest said Let us draw near to God here
And Saul inquired of God Shall I go down after the Philistines Will you give them into the hand of Israel But he did not answer him that day
And Saul said Come here all you leaders of the people and know and see how this sin has arisen today
For as the LORD lives who saves Israel though it be in Jonathan my son he shall surely die But there was not a man among all the people who answered him
Then he said to all Israel You shall be on one side and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side And the people said to Saul Do what seems good to you
Therefore Saul said O LORD God of Israel why have you not answered your servant this day If this guilt is in me or in Jonathan my son O LORD God of Israel give Urim But if this guilt is in your people Israel give Thummim And Jonathan and Saul were taken but the people escaped
Then Saul said Cast the lot between me and my son Jonathan And Jonathan was taken
Then Saul said to Jonathan Tell me what you have done And Jonathan told him I tasted a little honey with the tip of the staff that was in my hand Here I am I will die
And Saul said God do so to me and more also you shall surely die Jonathan
Then the people said to Saul Shall Jonathan die who has worked this great salvation in Israel Far from it As the LORD lives there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground for he has worked with God this day So the people ransomed Jonathan so that he did not die
Then Saul went up from pursuing the Philistines and the Philistines went to their own place
When Saul had taken the kingship over Israel he fought against all his enemies on every side against Moab against the Ammonites against Edom against the kings of Zobah and against the Philistines Wherever he turned he routed them
And he did valiantly and struck the Amalekites and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who plundered them
Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan Ishvi and Malchi shua And the names of his two daughters were these the name of the firstborn was Merab and the name of the younger Michal
And the name of Saul s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz And the name of the commander of his army was Abner the son of Ner Saul s uncle
Kish was the father of Saul and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel
There was hard fighting against the Philistines all the days of Saul And when Saul saw any strong man or any valiant man he attached him to himself
