Jonah 3
Then the word of the LORD came to Jonah the second time saying
Arise go to Nineveh that great city and call out against it the message that I tell you
So Jonah arose and went to Nineveh according to the word of the LORD Now Nineveh was an exceedingly great city three days journey in breadth
Jonah began to go into the city going a day s journey And he called out Yet forty days and Nineveh shall be overthrown
And the people of Nineveh believed God They called for a fast and put on sackcloth from the greatest of them to the least of them
The word reached the king of Nineveh and he arose from his throne removed his robe covered himself with sackcloth and sat in ashes
And he issued a proclamation and published through Nineveh By the decree of the king and his nobles Let neither man nor beast herd nor flock taste anything Let them not feed or drink water
but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth and let them call out mightily to God Let everyone turn from his evil way and from the violence that is in his hands
Who knows God may turn and relent and turn from his fierce anger so that we may not perish
When God saw what they did how they turned from their evil way God relented of the disaster that he had said he would do to them and he did not do it
