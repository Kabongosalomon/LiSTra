Hebrews 12
Therefore since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses let us also lay aside every weight and sin which clings so closely and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us
looking to Jesus the founder and perfecter of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God
Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted
In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood
And have you forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons My son do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord nor be weary when reproved by him
For the Lord disciplines the one he loves and chastises every son whom he receives
It is for discipline that you have to endure God is treating you as sons For what son is there whom his father does not discipline
If you are left without discipline in which all have participated then you are illegitimate children and not sons
Besides this we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we respected them Shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live
For they disciplined us for a short time as it seemed best to them but he disciplines us for our good that we may share his holiness
For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it
Therefore lift your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees
and make straight paths for your feet so that what is lame may not be put out of joint but rather be healed
Strive for peace with everyone and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord
See to it that no one fails to obtain the grace of God that no root of bitterness springs up and causes trouble and by it many become defiled
that no one is sexually immoral or unholy like Esau who sold his birthright for a single meal
For you know that afterward when he desired to inherit the blessing he was rejected for he found no chance to repent though he sought it with tears
For you have not come to what may be touched a blazing fire and darkness and gloom and a tempest
and the sound of a trumpet and a voice whose words made the hearers beg that no further messages be spoken to them
For they could not endure the order that was given If even a beast touches the mountain it shall be stoned
Indeed so terrifying was the sight that Moses said I tremble with fear
But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to innumerable angels in festal gathering
and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect
and to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel
See that you do not refuse him who is speaking For if they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth much less will we escape if we reject him who warns from heaven
At that time his voice shook the earth but now he has promised Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens
This phrase Yet once more indicates the removal of things that are shaken that is things that have been made in order that the things that cannot be shaken may remain
Therefore let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken and thus let us offer to God acceptable worship with reverence and awe
for our God is a consuming fire
