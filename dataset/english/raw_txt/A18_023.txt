Job 23
Then Job answered and said
Today also my complaint is bitter my hand is heavy on account of my groaning
Oh that I knew where I might find him that I might come even to his seat
I would lay my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments
I would know what he would answer me and understand what he would say to me
Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power No he would pay attention to me
There an upright man could argue with him and I would be acquitted forever by my judge
Behold I go forward but he is not there and backward but I do not perceive him
on the left hand when he is working I do not behold him he turns to the right hand but I do not see him
But he knows the way that I take when he has tried me I shall come out as gold
My foot has held fast to his steps I have kept his way and have not turned aside
I have not departed from the commandment of his lips I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my portion of food
But he is unchangeable and who can turn him back What he desires that he does
For he will complete what he appoints for me and many such things are in his mind
Therefore I am terrified at his presence when I consider I am in dread of him
God has made my heart faint the Almighty has terrified me
yet I am not silenced because of the darkness nor because thick darkness covers my face
