2 Corienthians 9
Now it is superfluous for me to write to you about the ministry for the saints
for I know your readiness of which I boast about you to the people of Macedonia saying that Achaia has been ready since last year And your zeal has stirred up most of them
But I am sending the brothers so that our boasting about you may not prove empty in this matter so that you may be ready as I said you would be
Otherwise if some Macedonians come with me and find that you are not ready we would be humiliated to say nothing of you for being so confident
So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead to you and arrange in advance for the gift you have promised so that it may be ready as a willing gift not as an exaction
The point is this whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully
Each one must give as he has decided in his heart not reluctantly or under compulsion for God loves a cheerful giver
And God is able to make all grace abound to you so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times you may abound in every good work
As it is written He has distributed freely he has given to the poor his righteousness endures forever
He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness
You will be enriched in every way to be generous in every way which through us will produce thanksgiving to God
For the ministry of this service is not only supplying the needs of the saints but is also overflowing in many thanksgivings to God
By their approval of this service they will glorify God because of your submission flowing from your confession of the gospel of Christ and the generosity of your contribution for them and for all others
while they long for you and pray for you because of the surpassing grace of God upon you
Thanks be to God for his inexpressible gift
