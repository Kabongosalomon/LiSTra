John 15
I am the true vine and my Father is the vinedresser
Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes that it may bear more fruit
Already you are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you
Abide in me and I in you As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it abides in the vine neither can you unless you abide in me
I am the vine you are the branches Whoever abides in me and I in him he it is that bears much fruit for apart from me you can do nothing
If anyone does not abide in me he is thrown away like a branch and withers and the branches are gathered thrown into the fire and burned
If you abide in me and my words abide in you ask whatever you wish and it will be done for you
By this my Father is glorified that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples
As the Father has loved me so have I loved you Abide in my love
If you keep my commandments you will abide in my love just as I have kept my Father s commandments and abide in his love
These things I have spoken to you that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be full
This is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you
Greater love has no one than this that someone lay down his life for his friends
You are my friends if you do what I command you
No longer do I call you servants for the servant does not know what his master is doing but I have called you friends for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you
You did not choose me but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide so that whatever you ask the Father in my name he may give it to you
These things I command you so that you will love one another
If the world hates you know that it has hated me before it hated you
If you were of the world the world would love you as its own but because you are not of the world but I chose you out of the world therefore the world hates you
Remember the word that I said to you A servant is not greater than his master If they persecuted me they will also persecute you If they kept my word they will also keep yours
But all these things they will do to you on account of my name because they do not know him who sent me
If I had not come and spoken to them they would not have been guilty of sin but now they have no excuse for their sin
Whoever hates me hates my Father also
If I had not done among them the works that no one else did they would not be guilty of sin but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father
But the word that is written in their Law must be fulfilled They hated me without a cause
But when the Helper comes whom I will send to you from the Father the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father he will bear witness about me
And you also will bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning
