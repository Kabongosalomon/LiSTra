Acts 20
After the uproar ceased Paul sent for the disciples and after encouraging them he said farewell and departed for Macedonia
When he had gone through those regions and had given them much encouragement he came to Greece
There he spent three months and when a plot was made against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria he decided to return through Macedonia
Sopater the Berean son of Pyrrhus accompanied him and of the Thessalonians Aristarchus and Secundus and Gaius of Derbe and Timothy and the Asians Tychicus and Trophimus
These went on ahead and were waiting for us at Troas
but we sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread and in five days we came to them at Troas where we stayed for seven days
On the first day of the week when we were gathered together to break bread Paul talked with them intending to depart on the next day and he prolonged his speech until midnight
There were many lamps in the upper room where we were gathered
And a young man named Eutychus sitting at the window sank into a deep sleep as Paul talked still longer And being overcome by sleep he fell down from the third story and was taken up dead
But Paul went down and bent over him and taking him in his arms said Do not be alarmed for his life is in him
And when Paul had gone up and had broken bread and eaten he conversed with them a long while until daybreak and so departed
And they took the youth away alive and were not a little comforted
But going ahead to the ship we set sail for Assos intending to take Paul aboard there for so he had arranged intending himself to go by land
And when he met us at Assos we took him on board and went to Mitylene
And sailing from there we came the following day opposite Chios the next day we touched at Samos and the day after that we went to Miletus
For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus so that he might not have to spend time in Asia for he was hastening to be at Jerusalem if possible on the day of Pentecost
Now from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the church to come to him
And when they came to him he said to them You yourselves know how I lived among you the whole time from the first day that I set foot in Asia
serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials that happened to me through the plots of the Jews
how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable and teaching you in public and from house to house
testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance toward God and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ
And now behold I am going to Jerusalem constrained by the Spirit not knowing what will happen to me there
except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that imprisonment and afflictions await me
But I do not account my life of any value nor as precious to myself if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus to testify to the gospel of the grace of God
And now behold I know that none of you among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom will see my face again
Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all of you
for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God
Pay careful attention to yourselves and to all the flock in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers to care for the church of God which he obtained with his own blood
I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you not sparing the flock
and from among your own selves will arise men speaking twisted things to draw away the disciples after them
Therefore be alert remembering that for three years I did not cease night or day to admonish everyone with tears
And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified
I coveted no one s silver or gold or apparel
You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my necessities and to those who were with me
In all things I have shown you that by working hard in this way we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus how he himself said It is more blessed to give than to receive
And when he had said these things he knelt down and prayed with them all
And there was much weeping on the part of all they embraced Paul and kissed him
being sorrowful most of all because of the word he had spoken that they would not see his face again And they accompanied him to the ship
