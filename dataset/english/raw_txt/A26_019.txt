Ezekiel 19
And you take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel
and say What was your mother A lioness Among lions she crouched in the midst of young lions she reared her cubs
And she brought up one of her cubs he became a young lion and he learned to catch prey he devoured men
The nations heard about him he was caught in their pit and they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt
When she saw that she waited in vain that her hope was lost she took another of her cubs and made him a young lion
He prowled among the lions he became a young lion and he learned to catch prey he devoured men
and seized their widows He laid waste their cities and the land was appalled and all who were in it at the sound of his roaring
Then the nations set against him from provinces on every side they spread their net over him he was taken in their pit
With hooks they put him in a cage and brought him to the king of Babylon they brought him into custody that his voice should no more be heard on the mountains of Israel
Your mother was like a vine in a vineyard planted by the water fruitful and full of branches by reason of abundant water
Its strong stems became rulers scepters it towered aloft among the thick boughs it was seen in its height with the mass of its branches
But the vine was plucked up in fury cast down to the ground the east wind dried up its fruit they were stripped off and withered As for its strong stem fire consumed it
Now it is planted in the wilderness in a dry and thirsty land
And fire has gone out from the stem of its shoots has consumed its fruit so that there remains in it no strong stem no scepter for ruling This is a lamentation and has become a lamentation
