Isaiah 57
The righteous man perishes and no one lays it to heart devout men are taken away while no one understands For the righteous man is taken away from calamity
he enters into peace they rest in their beds who walk in their uprightness
But you draw near sons of the sorceress offspring of the adulterer and the loose woman
Whom are you mocking Against whom do you open your mouth wide and stick out your tongue Are you not children of transgression the offspring of deceit
you who burn with lust among the oaks under every green tree who slaughter your children in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks
Among the smooth stones of the valley is your portion they they are your lot to them you have poured out a drink offering you have brought a grain offering Shall I relent for these things
On a high and lofty mountain you have set your bed and there you went up to offer sacrifice
Behind the door and the doorpost you have set up your memorial for deserting me you have uncovered your bed you have gone up to it you have made it wide and you have made a covenant for yourself with them you have loved their bed you have looked on nakedness
You journeyed to the king with oil and multiplied your perfumes you sent your envoys far off and sent down even to Sheol
You were wearied with the length of your way but you did not say It is hopeless you found new life for your strength and so you were not faint
Whom did you dread and fear so that you lied and did not remember me did not lay it to heart Have I not held my peace even for a long time and you do not fear me
I will declare your righteousness and your deeds but they will not profit you
When you cry out let your collection of idols deliver you The wind will carry them off a breath will take them away But he who takes refuge in me shall possess the land and shall inherit my holy mountain
And it shall be said Build up build up prepare the way remove every obstruction from my people s way
For thus says the One who is high and lifted up who inhabits eternity whose name is Holy I dwell in the high and holy place and also with him who is of a contrite and lowly spirit to revive the spirit of the lowly and to revive the heart of the contrite
For I will not contend forever nor will I always be angry for the spirit would grow faint before me and the breath of life that I made
Because of the iniquity of his unjust gain I was angry I struck him I hid my face and was angry but he went on backsliding in the way of his own heart
I have seen his ways but I will heal him I will lead him and restore comfort to him and his mourners
creating the fruit of the lips Peace peace to the far and to the near says the LORD and I will heal him
But the wicked are like the tossing sea for it cannot be quiet and its waters toss up mire and dirt
There is no peace says my God for the wicked
