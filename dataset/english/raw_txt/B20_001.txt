James 1
James a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ To the twelve tribes in the Dispersion Greetings
Count it all joy my brothers when you meet trials of various kinds
for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness
And let steadfastness have its full effect that you may be perfect and complete lacking in nothing
If any of you lacks wisdom let him ask God who gives generously to all without reproach and it will be given him
But let him ask in faith with no doubting for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind
For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord
he is a double minded man unstable in all his ways
Let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation
and the rich in his humiliation because like a flower of the grass he will pass away
For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the grass its flower falls and its beauty perishes So also will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits
Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life which God has promised to those who love him
Let no one say when he is tempted I am being tempted by God for God cannot be tempted with evil and he himself tempts no one
But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire
Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin and sin when it is fully grown brings forth death
Do not be deceived my beloved brothers
Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above coming down from the Father of lights with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change
Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures
Know this my beloved brothers let every person be quick to hear slow to speak slow to anger
for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God
Therefore put away all filthiness and rampant wickedness and receive with meekness the implanted word which is able to save your souls
But be doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving yourselves
For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror
For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like
But the one who looks into the perfect law the law of liberty and perseveres being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts he will be blessed in his doing
If anyone thinks he is religious and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart this person s religion is worthless
Religion that is pure and undefiled before God the Father is this to visit orphans and widows in their affliction and to keep oneself unstained from the world
