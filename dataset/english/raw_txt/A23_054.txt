Isaiah 54
Sing O barren one who did not bear break forth into singing and cry aloud you who have not been in labor For the children of the desolate one will be more than the children of her who is married says the LORD
Enlarge the place of your tent and let the curtains of your habitations be stretched out do not hold back lengthen your cords and strengthen your stakes
For you will spread abroad to the right and to the left and your offspring will possess the nations and will people the desolate cities
Fear not for you will not be ashamed be not confounded for you will not be disgraced for you will forget the shame of your youth and the reproach of your widowhood you will remember no more
For your Maker is your husband the LORD of hosts is his name and the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer the God of the whole earth he is called
For the LORD has called you like a wife deserted and grieved in spirit like a wife of youth when she is cast off says your God
For a brief moment I deserted you but with great compassion I will gather you
In overflowing anger for a moment I hid my face from you but with everlasting love I will have compassion on you says the LORD your Redeemer
This is like the days of Noah to me as I swore that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you and will not rebuke you
For the mountains may depart and the hills be removed but my steadfast love shall not depart from you and my covenant of peace shall not be removed says the LORD who has compassion on you
O afflicted one storm tossed and not comforted behold I will set your stones in antimony and lay your foundations with sapphires
I will make your pinnacles of agate your gates of carbuncles and all your wall of precious stones
All your children shall be taught by the LORD and great shall be the peace of your children
In righteousness you shall be established you shall be far from oppression for you shall not fear and from terror for it shall not come near you
If anyone stirs up strife it is not from me whoever stirs up strife with you shall fall because of you
Behold I have created the smith who blows the fire of coals and produces a weapon for its purpose I have also created the ravager to destroy
no weapon that is fashioned against you shall succeed and you shall confute every tongue that rises against you in judgment This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD and their vindication from me declares the LORD
