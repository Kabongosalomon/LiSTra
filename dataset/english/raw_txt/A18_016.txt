Job 16
Then Job answered and said
I have heard many such things miserable comforters are you all
Shall windy words have an end Or what provokes you that you answer
I also could speak as you do if you were in my place I could join words together against you and shake my head at you
I could strengthen you with my mouth and the solace of my lips would assuage your pain
If I speak my pain is not assuaged and if I forbear how much of it leaves me
Surely now God has worn me out he has made desolate all my company
And he has shriveled me up which is a witness against me and my leanness has risen up against me it testifies to my face
He has torn me in his wrath and hated me he has gnashed his teeth at me my adversary sharpens his eyes against me
Men have gaped at me with their mouth they have struck me insolently on the cheek they mass themselves together against me
God gives me up to the ungodly and casts me into the hands of the wicked
I was at ease and he broke me apart he seized me by the neck and dashed me to pieces he set me up as his target
his archers surround me He slashes open my kidneys and does not spare he pours out my gall on the ground
He breaks me with breach upon breach he runs upon me like a warrior
I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin and have laid my strength in the dust
My face is red with weeping and on my eyelids is deep darkness
although there is no violence in my hands and my prayer is pure
O earth cover not my blood and let my cry find no resting place
Even now behold my witness is in heaven and he who testifies for me is on high
My friends scorn me my eye pours out tears to God
that he would argue the case of a man with God as a son of man does with his neighbor
For when a few years have come I shall go the way from which I shall not return
