Habakkuk 1
The oracle that Habakkuk the prophet saw
O LORD how long shall I cry for help and you will not hear Or cry to you Violence and you will not save
Why do you make me see iniquity and why do you idly look at wrong Destruction and violence are before me strife and contention arise
So the law is paralyzed and justice never goes forth For the wicked surround the righteous so justice goes forth perverted
Look among the nations and see wonder and be astounded For I am doing a work in your days that you would not believe if told
For behold I am raising up the Chaldeans that bitter and hasty nation who march through the breadth of the earth to seize dwellings not their own
They are dreaded and fearsome their justice and dignity go forth from themselves
Their horses are swifter than leopards more fierce than the evening wolves their horsemen press proudly on Their horsemen come from afar they fly like an eagle swift to devour
They all come for violence all their faces forward They gather captives like sand
At kings they scoff and at rulers they laugh They laugh at every fortress for they pile up earth and take it
Then they sweep by like the wind and go on guilty men whose own might is their god
Are you not from everlasting O LORD my God my Holy One We shall not die O LORD you have ordained them as a judgment and you O Rock have established them for reproof
You who are of purer eyes than to see evil and cannot look at wrong why do you idly look at traitors and remain silent when the wicked swallows up the man more righteous than he
You make mankind like the fish of the sea like crawling things that have no ruler
He brings all of them up with a hook he drags them out with his net he gathers them in his dragnet so he rejoices and is glad
Therefore he sacrifices to his net and makes offerings to his dragnet for by them he lives in luxury and his food is rich
Is he then to keep on emptying his net and mercilessly killing nations forever
