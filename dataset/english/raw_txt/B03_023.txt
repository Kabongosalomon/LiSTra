Luke 23
Then the whole company of them arose and brought him before Pilate
And they began to accuse him saying We found this man misleading our nation and forbidding us to give tribute to Caesar and saying that he himself is Christ a king
And Pilate asked him Are you the King of the Jews And he answered him You have said so
Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds I find no guilt in this man
But they were urgent saying He stirs up the people teaching throughout all Judea from Galilee even to this place
When Pilate heard this he asked whether the man was a Galilean
And when he learned that he belonged to Herod s jurisdiction he sent him over to Herod who was himself in Jerusalem at that time
When Herod saw Jesus he was very glad for he had long desired to see him because he had heard about him and he was hoping to see some sign done by him
So he questioned him at some length but he made no answer
The chief priests and the scribes stood by vehemently accusing him
And Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him Then arraying him in splendid clothing he sent him back to Pilate
And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day for before this they had been at enmity with each other
Pilate then called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people
and said to them You brought me this man as one who was misleading the people And after examining him before you behold I did not find this man guilty of any of your charges against him
Neither did Herod for he sent him back to us Look nothing deserving death has been done by him
I will therefore punish and release him
But they all cried out together Away with this man and release to us Barabbas
a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection started in the city and for murder
Pilate addressed them once more desiring to release Jesus
but they kept shouting Crucify crucify him
A third time he said to them Why what evil has he done I have found in him no guilt deserving death I will therefore punish and release him
But they were urgent demanding with loud cries that he should be crucified And their voices prevailed
So Pilate decided that their demand should be granted
He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder for whom they asked but he delivered Jesus over to their will
And as they led him away they seized one Simon of Cyrene who was coming in from the country and laid on him the cross to carry it behind Jesus
And there followed him a great multitude of the people and of women who were mourning and lamenting for him
But turning to them Jesus said Daughters of Jerusalem do not weep for me but weep for yourselves and for your children
For behold the days are coming when they will say Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed
Then they will begin to say to the mountains Fall on us and to the hills Cover us
For if they do these things when the wood is green what will happen when it is dry
Two others who were criminals were led away to be put to death with him
And when they came to the place that is called The Skull there they crucified him and the criminals one on his right and one on his left
And Jesus said Father forgive them for they know not what they do And they cast lots to divide his garments
And the people stood by watching but the rulers scoffed at him saying He saved others let him save himself if he is the Christ of God his Chosen One
The soldiers also mocked him coming up and offering him sour wine
and saying If you are the King of the Jews save yourself
There was also an inscription over him This is the King of the Jews
One of the criminals who were hanged railed at him saying Are you not the Christ Save yourself and us
But the other rebuked him saying Do you not fear God since you are under the same sentence of condemnation
And we indeed justly for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds but this man has done nothing wrong
And he said Jesus remember me when you come into your kingdom
And he said to him Truly I say to you today you will be with me in Paradise
It was now about the sixth hour and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour
while the sun s light failed And the curtain of the temple was torn in two
Then Jesus calling out with a loud voice said Father into your hands I commit my spirit And having said this he breathed his last
Now when the centurion saw what had taken place he praised God saying Certainly this man was innocent
And all the crowds that had assembled for this spectacle when they saw what had taken place returned home beating their breasts
And all his acquaintances and the women who had followed him from Galilee stood at a distance watching these things
Now there was a man named Joseph from the Jewish town of Arimathea He was a member of the council a good and righteous man
who had not consented to their decision and action and he was looking for the kingdom of God
This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus
Then he took it down and wrapped it in a linen shroud and laid him in a tomb cut in stone where no one had ever yet been laid
It was the day of Preparation and the Sabbath was beginning
The women who had come with him from Galilee followed and saw the tomb and how his body was laid
Then they returned and prepared spices and ointments On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment
