Exodus 22
If a man steals an ox or a sheep and kills it or sells it he shall repay five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep
If a thief is found breaking in and is struck so that he dies there shall be no bloodguilt for him
but if the sun has risen on him there shall be bloodguilt for him He shall surely pay If he has nothing then he shall be sold for his theft
If the stolen beast is found alive in his possession whether it is an ox or a donkey or a sheep he shall pay double
If a man causes a field or vineyard to be grazed over or lets his beast loose and it feeds in another man s field he shall make restitution from the best in his own field and in his own vineyard
If fire breaks out and catches in thorns so that the stacked grain or the standing grain or the field is consumed he who started the fire shall make full restitution
If a man gives to his neighbor money or goods to keep safe and it is stolen from the man s house then if the thief is found he shall pay double
If the thief is not found the owner of the house shall come near to God to show whether or not he has put his hand to his neighbor s property
For every breach of trust whether it is for an ox for a donkey for a sheep for a cloak or for any kind of lost thing of which one says This is it the case of both parties shall come before God The one whom God condemns shall pay double to his neighbor
If a man gives to his neighbor a donkey or an ox or a sheep or any beast to keep safe and it dies or is injured or is driven away without anyone seeing it
an oath by the LORD shall be between them both to see whether or not he has put his hand to his neighbor s property The owner shall accept the oath and he shall not make restitution
But if it is stolen from him he shall make restitution to its owner
If it is torn by beasts let him bring it as evidence He shall not make restitution for what has been torn
If a man borrows anything of his neighbor and it is injured or dies the owner not being with it he shall make full restitution
If the owner was with it he shall not make restitution if it was hired it came for its hiring fee
If a man seduces a virgin who is not betrothed and lies with her he shall give the bride price for her and make her his wife
If her father utterly refuses to give her to him he shall pay money equal to the bride price for virgins
You shall not permit a sorceress to live
Whoever lies with an animal shall be put to death
Whoever sacrifices to any god other than the LORD alone shall be devoted to destruction
You shall not wrong a sojourner or oppress him for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt
You shall not mistreat any widow or fatherless child
If you do mistreat them and they cry out to me I will surely hear their cry
and my wrath will burn and I will kill you with the sword and your wives shall become widows and your children fatherless
If you lend money to any of my people with you who is poor you shall not be like a moneylender to him and you shall not exact interest from him
If ever you take your neighbor s cloak in pledge you shall return it to him before the sun goes down
for that is his only covering and it is his cloak for his body in what else shall he sleep And if he cries to me I will hear for I am compassionate
You shall not revile God nor curse a ruler of your people
You shall not delay to offer from the fullness of your harvest and from the outflow of your presses The firstborn of your sons you shall give to me
You shall do the same with your oxen and with your sheep seven days it shall be with its mother on the eighth day you shall give it to me
You shall be consecrated to me Therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn by beasts in the field you shall throw it to the dogs
