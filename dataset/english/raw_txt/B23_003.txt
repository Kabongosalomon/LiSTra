1 John 3
See what kind of love the Father has given to us that we should be called children of God and so we are The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him
Beloved we are God s children now and what we will be has not yet appeared but we know that when he appears we shall be like him because we shall see him as he is
And everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure
Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness sin is lawlessness
You know that he appeared to take away sins and in him there is no sin
No one who abides in him keeps on sinning no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him
Little children let no one deceive you Whoever practices righteousness is righteous as he is righteous
Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil for the devil has been sinning from the beginning The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil
No one born of God makes a practice of sinning for God s seed abides in him and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God
By this it is evident who are the children of God and who are the children of the devil whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God nor is the one who does not love his brother
For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning that we should love one another
We should not be like Cain who was of the evil one and murdered his brother And why did he murder him Because his own deeds were evil and his brother s righteous
Do not be surprised brothers that the world hates you
We know that we have passed out of death into life because we love the brothers Whoever does not love abides in death
Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him
By this we know love that he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers
But if anyone has the world s goods and sees his brother in need yet closes his heart against him how does God s love abide in him
Little children let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth
By this we shall know that we are of the truth and reassure our heart before him
for whenever our heart condemns us God is greater than our heart and he knows everything
Beloved if our heart does not condemn us we have confidence before God
and whatever we ask we receive from him because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him
And this is his commandment that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another just as he has commanded us
Whoever keeps his commandments abides in God and God in him And by this we know that he abides in us by the Spirit whom he has given us
