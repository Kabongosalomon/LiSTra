Zechariah 2
And I lifted my eyes and saw and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand
Then I said Where are you going And he said to me To measure Jerusalem to see what is its width and what is its length
And behold the angel who talked with me came forward and another angel came forward to meet him
and said to him Run say to that young man Jerusalem shall be inhabited as villages without walls because of the multitude of people and livestock in it
And I will be to her a wall of fire all around declares the LORD and I will be the glory in her midst
Up Up Flee from the land of the north declares the LORD For I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heavens declares the LORD
Up Escape to Zion you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon
For thus said the LORD of hosts after his glory sent me to the nations who plundered you for he who touches you touches the apple of his eye
Behold I will shake my hand over them and they shall become plunder for those who served them Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me
Sing and rejoice O daughter of Zion for behold I come and I will dwell in your midst declares the LORD
And many nations shall join themselves to the LORD in that day and shall be my people And I will dwell in your midst and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you
And the LORD will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land and will again choose Jerusalem
Be silent all flesh before the LORD for he has roused himself from his holy dwelling
