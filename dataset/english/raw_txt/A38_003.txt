Zechariah 3
Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him
And the LORD said to Satan The LORD rebuke you O Satan The LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you Is not this a brand plucked from the fire
Now Joshua was standing before the angel clothed with filthy garments
And the angel said to those who were standing before him Remove the filthy garments from him And to him he said Behold I have taken your iniquity away from you and I will clothe you with pure vestments
And I said Let them put a clean turban on his head So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments And the angel of the LORD was standing by
And the angel of the LORD solemnly assured Joshua
Thus says the LORD of hosts If you will walk in my ways and keep my charge then you shall rule my house and have charge of my courts and I will give you the right of access among those who are standing here
Hear now O Joshua the high priest you and your friends who sit before you for they are men who are a sign behold I will bring my servant the Branch
For behold on the stone that I have set before Joshua on a single stone with seven eyes I will engrave its inscription declares the LORD of hosts and I will remove the iniquity of this land in a single day
In that day declares the LORD of hosts every one of you will invite his neighbor to come under his vine and under his fig tree
