Leviticus 11
And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron saying to them
Speak to the people of Israel saying These are the living things that you may eat among all the animals that are on the earth
Whatever parts the hoof and is cloven footed and chews the cud among the animals you may eat
Nevertheless among those that chew the cud or part the hoof you shall not eat these The camel because it chews the cud but does not part the hoof is unclean to you
And the rock badger because it chews the cud but does not part the hoof is unclean to you
And the hare because it chews the cud but does not part the hoof is unclean to you
And the pig because it parts the hoof and is cloven footed but does not chew the cud is unclean to you
You shall not eat any of their flesh and you shall not touch their carcasses they are unclean to you
These you may eat of all that are in the waters Everything in the waters that has fins and scales whether in the seas or in the rivers you may eat
But anything in the seas or the rivers that has not fins and scales of the swarming creatures in the waters and of the living creatures that are in the waters is detestable to you
You shall regard them as detestable you shall not eat any of their flesh and you shall detest their carcasses
Everything in the waters that has not fins and scales is detestable to you
And these you shall detest among the birds they shall not be eaten they are detestable the eagle the bearded vulture the black vulture
the kite the falcon of any kind
every raven of any kind
the ostrich the nighthawk the sea gull the hawk of any kind
the little owl the cormorant the short eared owl
the barn owl the tawny owl the carrion vulture
the stork the heron of any kind the hoopoe and the bat
All winged insects that go on all fours are detestable to you
Yet among the winged insects that go on all fours you may eat those that have jointed legs above their feet with which to hop on the ground
Of them you may eat the locust of any kind the bald locust of any kind the cricket of any kind and the grasshopper of any kind
But all other winged insects that have four feet are detestable to you
And by these you shall become unclean Whoever touches their carcass shall be unclean until the evening
and whoever carries any part of their carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening
Every animal that parts the hoof but is not cloven footed or does not chew the cud is unclean to you Everyone who touches them shall be unclean
And all that walk on their paws among the animals that go on all fours are unclean to you Whoever touches their carcass shall be unclean until the evening
and he who carries their carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening they are unclean to you
And these are unclean to you among the swarming things that swarm on the ground the mole rat the mouse the great lizard of any kind
the gecko the monitor lizard the lizard the sand lizard and the chameleon
These are unclean to you among all that swarm Whoever touches them when they are dead shall be unclean until the evening
And anything on which any of them falls when they are dead shall be unclean whether it is an article of wood or a garment or a skin or a sack any article that is used for any purpose It must be put into water and it shall be unclean until the evening then it shall be clean
And if any of them falls into any earthenware vessel all that is in it shall be unclean and you shall break it
Any food in it that could be eaten on which water comes shall be unclean And all drink that could be drunk from every such vessel shall be unclean
And everything on which any part of their carcass falls shall be unclean Whether oven or stove it shall be broken in pieces They are unclean and shall remain unclean for you
Nevertheless a spring or a cistern holding water shall be clean but whoever touches a carcass in them shall be unclean
And if any part of their carcass falls upon any seed grain that is to be sown it is clean
but if water is put on the seed and any part of their carcass falls on it it is unclean to you
And if any animal which you may eat dies whoever touches its carcass shall be unclean until the evening
and whoever eats of its carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening And whoever carries the carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening
Every swarming thing that swarms on the ground is detestable it shall not be eaten
Whatever goes on its belly and whatever goes on all fours or whatever has many feet any swarming thing that swarms on the ground you shall not eat for they are detestable
You shall not make yourselves detestable with any swarming thing that swarms and you shall not defile yourselves with them and become unclean through them
For I am the LORD your God Consecrate yourselves therefore and be holy for I am holy You shall not defile yourselves with any swarming thing that crawls on the ground
For I am the LORD who brought you up out of the land of Egypt to be your God You shall therefore be holy for I am holy
This is the law about beast and bird and every living creature that moves through the waters and every creature that swarms on the ground
to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean and between the living creature that may be eaten and the living creature that may not be eaten
