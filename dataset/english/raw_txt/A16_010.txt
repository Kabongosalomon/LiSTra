We will not give our daughters to the peoples of the land or take their daughters for our sons
And if the peoples of the land bring in goods or any grain on the Sabbath day to sell we will not buy from them on the Sabbath or on a holy day And we will forego the crops of the seventh year and the exaction of every debt
We also take on ourselves the obligation to give yearly a third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God
for the showbread the regular grain offering the regular burnt offering the Sabbaths the new moons the appointed feasts the holy things and the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel and for all the work of the house of our God
We the priests the Levites and the people have likewise cast lots for the wood offering to bring it into the house of our God according to our fathers houses at times appointed year by year to burn on the altar of the LORD our God as it is written in the Law
We obligate ourselves to bring the firstfruits of our ground and the firstfruits of all fruit of every tree year by year to the house of the LORD
also to bring to the house of our God to the priests who minister in the house of our God the firstborn of our sons and of our cattle as it is written in the Law and the firstborn of our herds and of our flocks
and to bring the first of our dough and our contributions the fruit of every tree the wine and the oil to the priests to the chambers of the house of our God and to bring to the Levites the tithes from our ground for it is the Levites who collect the tithes in all our towns where we labor
And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites when the Levites receive the tithes And the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes to the house of our God to the chambers of the storehouse
For the people of Israel and the sons of Levi shall bring the contribution of grain wine and oil to the chambers where the vessels of the sanctuary are as well as the priests who minister and the gatekeepers and the singers We will not neglect the house of our God
