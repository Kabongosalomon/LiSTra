Leviticus 27
The LORD spoke to Moses saying
Speak to the people of Israel and say to them If anyone makes a special vow to the LORD involving the valuation of persons
then the valuation of a male from twenty years old up to sixty years old shall be fifty shekels of silver according to the shekel of the sanctuary
If the person is a female the valuation shall be thirty shekels
If the person is from five years old up to twenty years old the valuation shall be for a male twenty shekels and for a female ten shekels
If the person is from a month old up to five years old the valuation shall be for a male five shekels of silver and for a female the valuation shall be three shekels of silver
And if the person is sixty years old or over then the valuation for a male shall be fifteen shekels and for a female ten shekels
And if someone is too poor to pay the valuation then he shall be made to stand before the priest and the priest shall value him the priest shall value him according to what the vower can afford
If the vow is an animal that may be offered as an offering to the LORD all of it that he gives to the LORD is holy
He shall not exchange it or make a substitute for it good for bad or bad for good and if he does in fact substitute one animal for another then both it and the substitute shall be holy
And if it is any unclean animal that may not be offered as an offering to the LORD then he shall stand the animal before the priest
and the priest shall value it as either good or bad as the priest values it so it shall be
But if he wishes to redeem it he shall add a fifth to the valuation
When a man dedicates his house as a holy gift to the LORD the priest shall value it as either good or bad as the priest values it so it shall stand
And if the donor wishes to redeem his house he shall add a fifth to the valuation price and it shall be his
If a man dedicates to the LORD part of the land that is his possession then the valuation shall be in proportion to its seed A homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver
If he dedicates his field from the year of jubilee the valuation shall stand
but if he dedicates his field after the jubilee then the priest shall calculate the price according to the years that remain until the year of jubilee and a deduction shall be made from the valuation
And if he who dedicates the field wishes to redeem it then he shall add a fifth to its valuation price and it shall remain his
But if he does not wish to redeem the field or if he has sold the field to another man it shall not be redeemed anymore
But the field when it is released in the jubilee shall be a holy gift to the LORD like a field that has been devoted The priest shall be in possession of it
If he dedicates to the LORD a field that he has bought which is not a part of his possession
then the priest shall calculate the amount of the valuation for it up to the year of jubilee and the man shall give the valuation on that day as a holy gift to the LORD
In the year of jubilee the field shall return to him from whom it was bought to whom the land belongs as a possession
Every valuation shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary twenty gerahs shall make a shekel
But a firstborn of animals which as a firstborn belongs to the LORD no man may dedicate whether ox or sheep it is the LORD s
And if it is an unclean animal then he shall buy it back at the valuation and add a fifth to it or if it is not redeemed it shall be sold at the valuation
But no devoted thing that a man devotes to the LORD of anything that he has whether man or beast or of his inherited field shall be sold or redeemed every devoted thing is most holy to the LORD
No one devoted who is to be devoted for destruction from mankind shall be ransomed he shall surely be put to death
Every tithe of the land whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the trees is the LORD s it is holy to the LORD
If a man wishes to redeem some of his tithe he shall add a fifth to it
And every tithe of herds and flocks every tenth animal of all that pass under the herdsman s staff shall be holy to the LORD
One shall not differentiate between good or bad neither shall he make a substitute for it and if he does substitute for it then both it and the substitute shall be holy it shall not be redeemed
These are the commandments that the LORD commanded Moses for the people of Israel on Mount Sinai
