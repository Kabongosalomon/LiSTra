Proverbs 8
Does not wisdom call Does not understanding raise her voice
On the heights beside the way at the crossroads she takes her stand
beside the gates in front of the town at the entrance of the portals she cries aloud
To you O men I call and my cry is to the children of man
O simple ones learn prudence O fools learn sense
Hear for I will speak noble things and from my lips will come what is right
for my mouth will utter truth wickedness is an abomination to my lips
All the words of my mouth are righteous there is nothing twisted or crooked in them
They are all straight to him who understands and right to those who find knowledge
Take my instruction instead of silver and knowledge rather than choice gold
for wisdom is better than jewels and all that you may desire cannot compare with her
I wisdom dwell with prudence and I find knowledge and discretion
The fear of the LORD is hatred of evil Pride and arrogance and the way of evil and perverted speech I hate
I have counsel and sound wisdom I have insight I have strength
By me kings reign and rulers decree what is just
by me princes rule and nobles all who govern justly
I love those who love me and those who seek me diligently find me
Riches and honor are with me enduring wealth and righteousness
My fruit is better than gold even fine gold and my yield than choice silver
I walk in the way of righteousness in the paths of justice
granting an inheritance to those who love me and filling their treasuries
The LORD possessed me at the beginning of his work the first of his acts of old
Ages ago I was set up at the first before the beginning of the earth
When there were no depths I was brought forth when there were no springs abounding with water
Before the mountains had been shaped before the hills I was brought forth
before he had made the earth with its fields or the first of the dust of the world
When he established the heavens I was there when he drew a circle on the face of the deep
when he made firm the skies above when he established the fountains of the deep
when he assigned to the sea its limit so that the waters might not transgress his command when he marked out the foundations of the earth
then I was beside him like a master workman and I was daily his delight rejoicing before him always
rejoicing in his inhabited world and delighting in the children of man
And now O sons listen to me blessed are those who keep my ways
Hear instruction and be wise and do not neglect it
Blessed is the one who listens to me watching daily at my gates waiting beside my doors
For whoever finds me finds life and obtains favor from the LORD
but he who fails to find me injures himself all who hate me love death
