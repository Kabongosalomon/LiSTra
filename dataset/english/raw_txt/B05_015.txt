Acts 15
But some men came down from Judea and were teaching the brothers Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses you cannot be saved
And after Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and debate with them Paul and Barnabas and some of the others were appointed to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and the elders about this question
So being sent on their way by the church they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria describing in detail the conversion of the Gentiles and brought great joy to all the brothers
When they came to Jerusalem they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders and they declared all that God had done with them
But some believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees rose up and said It is necessary to circumcise them and to order them to keep the law of Moses
The apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider this matter
And after there had been much debate Peter stood up and said to them Brothers you know that in the early days God made a choice among you that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe
And God who knows the heart bore witness to them by giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us
and he made no distinction between us and them having cleansed their hearts by faith
Now therefore why are you putting God to the test by placing a yoke on the neck of the disciples that neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear
But we believe that we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus just as they will
And all the assembly fell silent and they listened to Barnabas and Paul as they related what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles
After they finished speaking James replied Brothers listen to me
Simeon has related how God first visited the Gentiles to take from them a people for his name
And with this the words of the prophets agree just as it is written
After this I will return and I will rebuild the tent of David that has fallen I will rebuild its ruins and I will restore it
that the remnant of mankind may seek the Lord and all the Gentiles who are called by my name says the Lord who makes these things
known from of old
Therefore my judgment is that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God
but should write to them to abstain from the things polluted by idols and from sexual immorality and from what has been strangled and from blood
For from ancient generations Moses has had in every city those who proclaim him for he is read every Sabbath in the synagogues
Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders with the whole church to choose men from among them and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas They sent Judas called Barsabbas and Silas leading men among the brothers
with the following letter The brothers both the apostles and the elders to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia greetings
Since we have heard that some persons have gone out from us and troubled you with words unsettling your minds although we gave them no instructions
it has seemed good to us having come to one accord to choose men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul
men who have risked their lives for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ
We have therefore sent Judas and Silas who themselves will tell you the same things by word of mouth
For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no greater burden than these requirements
that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what has been strangled and from sexual immorality If you keep yourselves from these you will do well Farewell
So when they were sent off they went down to Antioch and having gathered the congregation together they delivered the letter
And when they had read it they rejoiced because of its encouragement
And Judas and Silas who were themselves prophets encouraged and strengthened the brothers with many words
And after they had spent some time they were sent off in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them
But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch teaching and preaching the word of the Lord with many others also
And after some days Paul said to Barnabas Let us return and visit the brothers in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord and see how they are
Now Barnabas wanted to take with them John called Mark
But Paul thought best not to take with them one who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work
And there arose a sharp disagreement so that they separated from each other Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus
but Paul chose Silas and departed having been commended by the brothers to the grace of the Lord
And he went through Syria and Cilicia strengthening the churches
