2 Timothy 2
You then my child be strengthened by the grace that is in Christ Jesus
and what you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses entrust to faithful men who will be able to teach others also
Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus
No soldier gets entangled in civilian pursuits since his aim is to please the one who enlisted him
An athlete is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules
It is the hard working farmer who ought to have the first share of the crops
Think over what I say for the Lord will give you understanding in everything
Remember Jesus Christ risen from the dead the offspring of David as preached in my gospel
for which I am suffering bound with chains as a criminal But the word of God is not bound
Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory
The saying is trustworthy for If we have died with him we will also live with him
if we endure we will also reign with him if we deny him he also will deny us
if we are faithless he remains faithful for he cannot deny himself
Remind them of these things and charge them before God not to quarrel about words which does no good but only ruins the hearers
Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved a worker who has no need to be ashamed rightly handling the word of truth
But avoid irreverent babble for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness
and their talk will spread like gangrene Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus
who have swerved from the truth saying that the resurrection has already happened They are upsetting the faith of some
But God s firm foundation stands bearing this seal The Lord knows those who are his and Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity
Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and clay some for honorable use some for dishonorable
Therefore if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable he will be a vessel for honorable use set apart as holy useful to the master of the house ready for every good work
So flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness faith love and peace along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart
Have nothing to do with foolish ignorant controversies you know that they breed quarrels
And the Lord s servant must not be quarrelsome but kind to everyone able to teach patiently enduring evil
correcting his opponents with gentleness God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth
and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil after being captured by him to do his will
