Luke 13
There were some present at that very time who told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices
And he answered them Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered in this way
No I tell you but unless you repent you will all likewise perish
Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others who lived in Jerusalem
No I tell you but unless you repent you will all likewise perish
And he told this parable A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came seeking fruit on it and found none
And he said to the vinedresser Look for three years now I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree and I find none Cut it down Why should it use up the ground
And he answered him Sir let it alone this year also until I dig around it and put on manure
Then if it should bear fruit next year well and good but if not you can cut it down
Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath
And there was a woman who had had a disabling spirit for eighteen years She was bent over and could not fully straighten herself
When Jesus saw her he called her over and said to her Woman you are freed from your disability
And he laid his hands on her and immediately she was made straight and she glorified God
But the ruler of the synagogue indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath said to the people There are six days in which work ought to be done Come on those days and be healed and not on the Sabbath day
Then the Lord answered him You hypocrites Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger and lead it away to water it
And ought not this woman a daughter of Abraham whom Satan bound for eighteen years be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day
As he said these things all his adversaries were put to shame and all the people rejoiced at all the glorious things that were done by him
He said therefore What is the kingdom of God like And to what shall I compare it
It is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his garden and it grew and became a tree and the birds of the air made nests in its branches
And again he said To what shall I compare the kingdom of God
It is like leaven that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour until it was all leavened
He went on his way through towns and villages teaching and journeying toward Jerusalem
And someone said to him Lord will those who are saved be few And he said to them
Strive to enter through the narrow door For many I tell you will seek to enter and will not be able
When once the master of the house has risen and shut the door and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door saying Lord open to us then he will answer you I do not know where you come from
Then you will begin to say We ate and drank in your presence and you taught in our streets
But he will say I tell you I do not know where you come from Depart from me all you workers of evil
In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God but you yourselves cast out
And people will come from east and west and from north and south and recline at table in the kingdom of God
And behold some are last who will be first and some are first who will be last
At that very hour some Pharisees came and said to him Get away from here for Herod wants to kill you
And he said to them Go and tell that fox Behold I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow and the third day I finish my course
Nevertheless I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the day following for it cannot be that a prophet should perish away from Jerusalem
O Jerusalem Jerusalem the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings and you would not
Behold your house is forsaken And I tell you you will not see me until you say Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord
