Genesis 9
And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth
The fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every bird of the heavens upon everything that creeps on the ground and all the fish of the sea Into your hand they are delivered
Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you And as I gave you the green plants I give you everything
But you shall not eat flesh with its life that is its blood
And for your lifeblood I will require a reckoning from every beast I will require it and from man From his fellow man I will require a reckoning for the life of man
Whoever sheds the blood of man by man shall his blood be shed for God made man in his own image
And you be fruitful and multiply teem on the earth and multiply in it
Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him
Behold I establish my covenant with you and your offspring after you
and with every living creature that is with you the birds the livestock and every beast of the earth with you as many as came out of the ark it is for every beast of the earth
I establish my covenant with you that never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth
And God said This is the sign of the covenant that I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you for all future generations
I have set my bow in the cloud and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth
When I bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the clouds
I will remember my covenant that is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh And the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh
When the bow is in the clouds I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth
God said to Noah This is the sign of the covenant that I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth
The sons of Noah who went forth from the ark were Shem Ham and Japheth Ham was the father of Canaan
These three were the sons of Noah and from these the people of the whole earth were dispersed
Noah began to be a man of the soil and he planted a vineyard
He drank of the wine and became drunk and lay uncovered in his tent
And Ham the father of Canaan saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brothers outside
Then Shem and Japheth took a garment laid it on both their shoulders and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father Their faces were turned backward and they did not see their father s nakedness
When Noah awoke from his wine and knew what his youngest son had done to him
he said Cursed be Canaan a servant of servants shall he be to his brothers
He also said Blessed be the LORD the God of Shem and let Canaan be his servant
May God enlarge Japheth and let him dwell in the tents of Shem and let Canaan be his servant
After the flood Noah lived years
All the days of Noah were years and he died
