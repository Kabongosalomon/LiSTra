Ezekiel 15
And the word of the LORD came to me
Son of man how does the wood of the vine surpass any wood the vine branch that is among the trees of the forest
Is wood taken from it to make anything Do people take a peg from it to hang any vessel on it
Behold it is given to the fire for fuel When the fire has consumed both ends of it and the middle of it is charred is it useful for anything
Behold when it was whole it was used for nothing How much less when the fire has consumed it and it is charred can it ever be used for anything
Therefore thus says the Lord GOD Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest which I have given to the fire for fuel so have I given up the inhabitants of Jerusalem
And I will set my face against them Though they escape from the fire the fire shall yet consume them and you will know that I am the LORD when I set my face against them
And I will make the land desolate because they have acted faithlessly declares the Lord GOD
