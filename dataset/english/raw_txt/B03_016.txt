Luke 16
He also said to the disciples There was a rich man who had a manager and charges were brought to him that this man was wasting his possessions
And he called him and said to him What is this that I hear about you Turn in the account of your management for you can no longer be manager
And the manager said to himself What shall I do since my master is taking the management away from me I am not strong enough to dig and I am ashamed to beg
I have decided what to do so that when I am removed from management people may receive me into their houses
So summoning his master s debtors one by one he said to the first How much do you owe my master
He said A hundred measures of oil He said to him Take your bill and sit down quickly and write fifty
Then he said to another And how much do you owe He said A hundred measures of wheat He said to him Take your bill and write eighty
The master commended the dishonest manager for his shrewdness For the sons of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than the sons of light
And I tell you make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth so that when it fails they may receive you into the eternal dwellings
One who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much and one who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much
If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous wealth who will entrust to you the true riches
And if you have not been faithful in that which is another s who will give you that which is your own
No servant can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other You cannot serve God and money
The Pharisees who were lovers of money heard all these things and they ridiculed him
And he said to them You are those who justify yourselves before men but God knows your hearts For what is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God
The Law and the Prophets were until John since then the good news of the kingdom of God is preached and everyone forces his way into it
But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one dot of the Law to become void
Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery and he who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery
There was a rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day
And at his gate was laid a poor man named Lazarus covered with sores
who desired to be fed with what fell from the rich man s table Moreover even the dogs came and licked his sores
The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham s side The rich man also died and was buried
and in Hades being in torment he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side
And he called out Father Abraham have mercy on me and send Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue for I am in anguish in this flame
But Abraham said Child remember that you in your lifetime received your good things and Lazarus in like manner bad things but now he is comforted here and you are in anguish
And besides all this between us and you a great chasm has been fixed in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be able and none may cross from there to us
And he said Then I beg you father to send him to my father s house
for I have five brothers so that he may warn them lest they also come into this place of torment
But Abraham said They have Moses and the Prophets let them hear them
And he said No father Abraham but if someone goes to them from the dead they will repent
He said to him If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead
