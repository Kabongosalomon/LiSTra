Job 36
And Elihu continued and said
Bear with me a little and I will show you for I have yet something to say on God s behalf
I will get my knowledge from afar and ascribe righteousness to my Maker
For truly my words are not false one who is perfect in knowledge is with you
Behold God is mighty and does not despise any he is mighty in strength of understanding
He does not keep the wicked alive but gives the afflicted their right
He does not withdraw his eyes from the righteous but with kings on the throne he sets them forever and they are exalted
And if they are bound in chains and caught in the cords of affliction
then he declares to them their work and their transgressions that they are behaving arrogantly
He opens their ears to instruction and commands that they return from iniquity
If they listen and serve him they complete their days in prosperity and their years in pleasantness
But if they do not listen they perish by the sword and die without knowledge
The godless in heart cherish anger they do not cry for help when he binds them
They die in youth and their life ends among the cult prostitutes
He delivers the afflicted by their affliction and opens their ear by adversity
He also allured you out of distress into a broad place where there was no cramping and what was set on your table was full of fatness
But you are full of the judgment on the wicked judgment and justice seize you
Beware lest wrath entice you into scoffing and let not the greatness of the ransom turn you aside
Will your cry for help avail to keep you from distress or all the force of your strength
Do not long for the night when peoples vanish in their place
Take care do not turn to iniquity for this you have chosen rather than affliction
Behold God is exalted in his power who is a teacher like him
Who has prescribed for him his way or who can say You have done wrong
Remember to extol his work of which men have sung
All mankind has looked on it man beholds it from afar
Behold God is great and we know him not the number of his years is unsearchable
For he draws up the drops of water they distill his mist in rain
which the skies pour down and drop on mankind abundantly
Can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds the thunderings of his pavilion
Behold he scatters his lightning about him and covers the roots of the sea
For by these he judges peoples he gives food in abundance
He covers his hands with the lightning and commands it to strike the mark
Its crashing declares his presence the cattle also declare that he rises
