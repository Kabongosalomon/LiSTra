Genesis 49
Then Jacob called his sons and said Gather yourselves together that I may tell you what shall happen to you in days to come
Assemble and listen O sons of Jacob listen to Israel your father
Reuben you are my firstborn my might and the firstfruits of my strength preeminent in dignity and preeminent in power
Unstable as water you shall not have preeminence because you went up to your father s bed then you defiled it he went up to my couch
Simeon and Levi are brothers weapons of violence are their swords
Let my soul come not into their council O my glory be not joined to their company For in their anger they killed men and in their willfulness they hamstrung oxen
Cursed be their anger for it is fierce and their wrath for it is cruel I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel
Judah your brothers shall praise you your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies your father s sons shall bow down before you
Judah is a lion s cub from the prey my son you have gone up He stooped down he crouched as a lion and as a lioness who dares rouse him
The scepter shall not depart from Judah nor the ruler s staff from between his feet until tribute comes to him and to him shall be the obedience of the peoples
Binding his foal to the vine and his donkey s colt to the choice vine he has washed his garments in wine and his vesture in the blood of grapes
His eyes are darker than wine and his teeth whiter than milk
Zebulun shall dwell at the shore of the sea he shall become a haven for ships and his border shall be at Sidon
Issachar is a strong donkey crouching between the sheepfolds
He saw that a resting place was good and that the land was pleasant so he bowed his shoulder to bear and became a servant at forced labor
Dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel
Dan shall be a serpent in the way a viper by the path that bites the horse s heels so that his rider falls backward
I wait for your salvation O LORD
Raiders shall raid Gad but he shall raid at their heels
Asher s food shall be rich and he shall yield royal delicacies
Naphtali is a doe let loose that bears beautiful fawns
Joseph is a fruitful bough a fruitful bough by a spring his branches run over the wall
The archers bitterly attacked him shot at him and harassed him severely
yet his bow remained unmoved his arms were made agile by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob from there is the Shepherd the Stone of Israel
by the God of your father who will help you by the Almighty who will bless you with blessings of heaven above blessings of the deep that crouches beneath blessings of the breasts and of the womb
The blessings of your father are mighty beyond the blessings of my parents up to the bounties of the everlasting hills May they be on the head of Joseph and on the brow of him who was set apart from his brothers
Benjamin is a ravenous wolf in the morning devouring the prey and at evening dividing the spoil
All these are the twelve tribes of Israel This is what their father said to them as he blessed them blessing each with the blessing suitable to him
Then he commanded them and said to them I am to be gathered to my people bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite
in the cave that is in the field at Machpelah to the east of Mamre in the land of Canaan which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite to possess as a burying place
There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife There they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife and there I buried Leah
the field and the cave that is in it were bought from the Hittites
When Jacob finished commanding his sons he drew up his feet into the bed and breathed his last and was gathered to his people
