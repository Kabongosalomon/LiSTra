Matthew 11
When Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples he went on from there to teach and preach in their cities
Now when John heard in prison about the deeds of the Christ he sent word by his disciples
and said to him Are you the one who is to come or shall we look for another
And Jesus answered them Go and tell John what you hear and see
the blind receive their sight and the lame walk lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear and the dead are raised up and the poor have good news preached to them
And blessed is the one who is not offended by me
As they went away Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John What did you go out into the wilderness to see A reed shaken by the wind
What then did you go out to see A man dressed in soft clothing Behold those who wear soft clothing are in kings houses
What then did you go out to see A prophet Yes I tell you and more than a prophet
This is he of whom it is written Behold I send my messenger before your face who will prepare your way before you
Truly I say to you among those born of women there has arisen no one greater than John the Baptist Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he
From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence and the violent take it by force
For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John
and if you are willing to accept it he is Elijah who is to come
He who has ears to hear let him hear
But to what shall I compare this generation It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their playmates
We played the flute for you and you did not dance we sang a dirge and you did not mourn
For John came neither eating nor drinking and they say He has a demon
The Son of Man came eating and drinking and they say Look at him A glutton and a drunkard a friend of tax collectors and sinners Yet wisdom is justified by her deeds
Then he began to denounce the cities where most of his mighty works had been done because they did not repent
Woe to you Chorazin Woe to you Bethsaida For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes
But I tell you it will be more bearable on the day of judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you
And you Capernaum will you be exalted to heaven You will be brought down to Hades For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom it would have remained until this day
But I tell you that it will be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you
At that time Jesus declared I thank you Father Lord of heaven and earth that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children
yes Father for such was your gracious will
All things have been handed over to me by my Father and no one knows the Son except the Father and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him
Come to me all who labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me for I am gentle and lowly in heart and you will find rest for your souls
For my yoke is easy and my burden is light
