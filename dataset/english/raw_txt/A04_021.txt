Numbers 21
When the Canaanite the king of Arad who lived in the Negeb heard that Israel was coming by the way of Atharim he fought against Israel and took some of them captive
And Israel vowed a vow to the LORD and said If you will indeed give this people into my hand then I will devote their cities to destruction
And the LORD heeded the voice of Israel and gave over the Canaanites and they devoted them and their cities to destruction So the name of the place was called Hormah
From Mount Hor they set out by the way to the Red Sea to go around the land of Edom And the people became impatient on the way
And the people spoke against God and against Moses Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness For there is no food and no water and we loathe this worthless food
Then the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people so that many people of Israel died
And the people came to Moses and said We have sinned for we have spoken against the LORD and against you Pray to the LORD that he take away the serpents from us So Moses prayed for the people
And the LORD said to Moses Make a fiery serpent and set it on a pole and everyone who is bitten when he sees it shall live
So Moses made a bronze serpent and set it on a pole And if a serpent bit anyone he would look at the bronze serpent and live
And the people of Israel set out and camped in Oboth
And they set out from Oboth and camped at Iye abarim in the wilderness that is opposite Moab toward the sunrise
From there they set out and camped in the Valley of Zered
From there they set out and camped on the other side of the Arnon which is in the wilderness that extends from the border of the Amorites for the Arnon is the border of Moab between Moab and the Amorites
Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of the LORD Waheb in Suphah and the valleys of the Arnon
and the slope of the valleys that extends to the seat of Ar and leans to the border of Moab
And from there they continued to Beer that is the well of which the LORD said to Moses Gather the people together so that I may give them water
Then Israel sang this song Spring up O well Sing to it
the well that the princes made that the nobles of the people dug with the scepter and with their staffs And from the wilderness they went on to Mattanah
and from Mattanah to Nahaliel and from Nahaliel to Bamoth
and from Bamoth to the valley lying in the region of Moab by the top of Pisgah that looks down on the desert
Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites saying
Let me pass through your land We will not turn aside into field or vineyard We will not drink the water of a well We will go by the King s Highway until we have passed through your territory
But Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his territory He gathered all his people together and went out against Israel to the wilderness and came to Jahaz and fought against Israel
And Israel defeated him with the edge of the sword and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok as far as to the Ammonites for the border of the Ammonites was strong
And Israel took all these cities and Israel settled in all the cities of the Amorites in Heshbon and in all its villages
For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites who had fought against the former king of Moab and taken all his land out of his hand as far as the Arnon
Therefore the ballad singers say Come to Heshbon let it be built let the city of Sihon be established
For fire came out from Heshbon flame from the city of Sihon It devoured Ar of Moab and swallowed the heights of the Arnon
Woe to you O Moab You are undone O people of Chemosh He has made his sons fugitives and his daughters captives to an Amorite king Sihon
So we overthrew them Heshbon as far as Dibon perished and we laid waste as far as Nophah fire spread as far as Medeba
Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites
And Moses sent to spy out Jazer and they captured its villages and dispossessed the Amorites who were there
Then they turned and went up by the way to Bashan And Og the king of Bashan came out against them he and all his people to battle at Edrei
But the LORD said to Moses Do not fear him for I have given him into your hand and all his people and his land And you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites who lived at Heshbon
So they defeated him and his sons and all his people until he had no survivor left And they possessed his land
