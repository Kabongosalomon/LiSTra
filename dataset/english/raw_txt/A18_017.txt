Job 17
My spirit is broken my days are extinct the graveyard is ready for me
Surely there are mockers about me and my eye dwells on their provocation
Lay down a pledge for me with yourself who is there who will put up security for me
Since you have closed their hearts to understanding therefore you will not let them triumph
He who informs against his friends to get a share of their property the eyes of his children will fail
He has made me a byword of the peoples and I am one before whom men spit
My eye has grown dim from vexation and all my members are like a shadow
The upright are appalled at this and the innocent stirs himself up against the godless
Yet the righteous holds to his way and he who has clean hands grows stronger and stronger
But you come on again all of you and I shall not find a wise man among you
My days are past my plans are broken off the desires of my heart
They make night into day The light they say is near to the darkness
If I hope for Sheol as my house if I make my bed in darkness
if I say to the pit You are my father and to the worm My mother or My sister
where then is my hope Who will see my hope
Will it go down to the bars of Sheol Shall we descend together into the dust
