Proverbs 19
Better is a poor person who walks in his integrity than one who is crooked in speech and is a fool
Desire without knowledge is not good and whoever makes haste with his feet misses his way
When a man s folly brings his way to ruin his heart rages against the LORD
Wealth brings many new friends but a poor man is deserted by his friend
A false witness will not go unpunished and he who breathes out lies will not escape
Many seek the favor of a generous man and everyone is a friend to a man who gives gifts
All a poor man s brothers hate him how much more do his friends go far from him He pursues them with words but does not have them
Whoever gets sense loves his own soul he who keeps understanding will discover good
A false witness will not go unpunished and he who breathes out lies will perish
It is not fitting for a fool to live in luxury much less for a slave to rule over princes
Good sense makes one slow to anger and it is his glory to overlook an offense
A king s wrath is like the growling of a lion but his favor is like dew on the grass
A foolish son is ruin to his father and a wife s quarreling is a continual dripping of rain
House and wealth are inherited from fathers but a prudent wife is from the LORD
Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep and an idle person will suffer hunger
Whoever keeps the commandment keeps his life he who despises his ways will die
Whoever is generous to the poor lends to the LORD and he will repay him for his deed
Discipline your son for there is hope do not set your heart on putting him to death
A man of great wrath will pay the penalty for if you deliver him you will only have to do it again
Listen to advice and accept instruction that you may gain wisdom in the future
Many are the plans in the mind of a man but it is the purpose of the LORD that will stand
What is desired in a man is steadfast love and a poor man is better than a liar
The fear of the LORD leads to life and whoever has it rests satisfied he will not be visited by harm
The sluggard buries his hand in the dish and will not even bring it back to his mouth
Strike a scoffer and the simple will learn prudence reprove a man of understanding and he will gain knowledge
He who does violence to his father and chases away his mother is a son who brings shame and reproach
Cease to hear instruction my son and you will stray from the words of knowledge
A worthless witness mocks at justice and the mouth of the wicked devours iniquity
Condemnation is ready for scoffers and beating for the backs of fools
