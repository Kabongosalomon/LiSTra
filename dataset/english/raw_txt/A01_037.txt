Genesis 37
Jacob lived in the land of his father s sojournings in the land of Canaan
These are the generations of Jacob Joseph being seventeen years old was pasturing the flock with his brothers He was a boy with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah his father s wives And Joseph brought a bad report of them to their father
Now Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his sons because he was the son of his old age And he made him a robe of many colors
But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers they hated him and could not speak peacefully to him
Now Joseph had a dream and when he told it to his brothers they hated him even more
He said to them Hear this dream that I have dreamed
Behold we were binding sheaves in the field and behold my sheaf arose and stood upright And behold your sheaves gathered around it and bowed down to my sheaf
His brothers said to him Are you indeed to reign over us Or are you indeed to rule over us So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words
Then he dreamed another dream and told it to his brothers and said Behold I have dreamed another dream Behold the sun the moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me
But when he told it to his father and to his brothers his father rebuked him and said to him What is this dream that you have dreamed Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves to the ground before you
And his brothers were jealous of him but his father kept the saying in mind
Now his brothers went to pasture their father s flock near Shechem
And Israel said to Joseph Are not your brothers pasturing the flock at Shechem Come I will send you to them And he said to him Here I am
So he said to him Go now see if it is well with your brothers and with the flock and bring me word So he sent him from the Valley of Hebron and he came to Shechem
And a man found him wandering in the fields And the man asked him What are you seeking
I am seeking my brothers he said Tell me please where they are pasturing the flock
And the man said They have gone away for I heard them say Let us go to Dothan So Joseph went after his brothers and found them at Dothan
They saw him from afar and before he came near to them they conspired against him to kill him
They said to one another Here comes this dreamer
Come now let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits Then we will say that a fierce animal has devoured him and we will see what will become of his dreams
But when Reuben heard it he rescued him out of their hands saying Let us not take his life
And Reuben said to them Shed no blood throw him into this pit here in the wilderness but do not lay a hand on him that he might rescue him out of their hand to restore him to his father
So when Joseph came to his brothers they stripped him of his robe the robe of many colors that he wore
And they took him and threw him into a pit The pit was empty there was no water in it
Then they sat down to eat And looking up they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead with their camels bearing gum balm and myrrh on their way to carry it down to Egypt
Then Judah said to his brothers What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood
Come let us sell him to the Ishmaelites and let not our hand be upon him for he is our brother our own flesh And his brothers listened to him
Then Midianite traders passed by And they drew Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver They took Joseph to Egypt
When Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not in the pit he tore his clothes
and returned to his brothers and said The boy is gone and I where shall I go
Then they took Joseph s robe and slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood
And they sent the robe of many colors and brought it to their father and said This we have found please identify whether it is your son s robe or not
And he identified it and said It is my son s robe A fierce animal has devoured him Joseph is without doubt torn to pieces
Then Jacob tore his garments and put sackcloth on his loins and mourned for his son many days
All his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him but he refused to be comforted and said No I shall go down to Sheol to my son mourning Thus his father wept for him
Meanwhile the Midianites had sold him in Egypt to Potiphar an officer of Pharaoh the captain of the guard
