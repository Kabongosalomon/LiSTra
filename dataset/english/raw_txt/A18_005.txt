Job 5
Call now is there anyone who will answer you To which of the holy ones will you turn
Surely vexation kills the fool and jealousy slays the simple
I have seen the fool taking root but suddenly I cursed his dwelling
His children are far from safety they are crushed in the gate and there is no one to deliver them
The hungry eat his harvest and he takes it even out of thorns and the thirsty pant after his wealth
For affliction does not come from the dust nor does trouble sprout from the ground
but man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward
As for me I would seek God and to God would I commit my cause
who does great things and unsearchable marvelous things without number
he gives rain on the earth and sends waters on the fields
he sets on high those who are lowly and those who mourn are lifted to safety
He frustrates the devices of the crafty so that their hands achieve no success
He catches the wise in their own craftiness and the schemes of the wily are brought to a quick end
They meet with darkness in the daytime and grope at noonday as in the night
But he saves the needy from the sword of their mouth and from the hand of the mighty
So the poor have hope and injustice shuts her mouth
Behold blessed is the one whom God reproves therefore despise not the discipline of the Almighty
For he wounds but he binds up he shatters but his hands heal
He will deliver you from six troubles in seven no evil shall touch you
In famine he will redeem you from death and in war from the power of the sword
You shall be hidden from the lash of the tongue and shall not fear destruction when it comes
At destruction and famine you shall laugh and shall not fear the beasts of the earth
For you shall be in league with the stones of the field and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you
You shall know that your tent is at peace and you shall inspect your fold and miss nothing
You shall know also that your offspring shall be many and your descendants as the grass of the earth
You shall come to your grave in ripe old age like a sheaf gathered up in its season
Behold this we have searched out it is true Hear and know it for your good
