Romans 7
Or do you not know brothers for I am speaking to those who know the law that the law is binding on a person only as long as he lives
For a married woman is bound by law to her husband while he lives but if her husband dies she is released from the law of marriage
Accordingly she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive But if her husband dies she is free from that law and if she marries another man she is not an adulteress
Likewise my brothers you also have died to the law through the body of Christ so that you may belong to another to him who has been raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for God
For while we were living in the flesh our sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our members to bear fruit for death
But now we are released from the law having died to that which held us captive so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit and not in the old way of the written code
What then shall we say That the law is sin By no means Yet if it had not been for the law I would not have known sin For I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said You shall not covet
But sin seizing an opportunity through the commandment produced in me all kinds of covetousness For apart from the law sin lies dead
I was once alive apart from the law but when the commandment came sin came alive and I died
The very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me
For sin seizing an opportunity through the commandment deceived me and through it killed me
So the law is holy and the commandment is holy and righteous and good
Did that which is good then bring death to me By no means It was sin producing death in me through what is good in order that sin might be shown to be sin and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure
For we know that the law is spiritual but I am of the flesh sold under sin
For I do not understand my own actions For I do not do what I want but I do the very thing I hate
Now if I do what I do not want I agree with the law that it is good
So now it is no longer I who do it but sin that dwells within me
For I know that nothing good dwells in me that is in my flesh For I have the desire to do what is right but not the ability to carry it out
For I do not do the good I want but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing
Now if I do what I do not want it is no longer I who do it but sin that dwells within me
So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right evil lies close at hand
For I delight in the law of God in my inner being
but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members
Wretched man that I am Who will deliver me from this body of death
Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord So then I myself serve the law of God with my mind but with my flesh I serve the law of sin
