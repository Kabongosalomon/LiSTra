1 Peter 5
So I exhort the elders among you as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ as well as a partaker in the glory that is going to be revealed
shepherd the flock of God that is among you exercising oversight not under compulsion but willingly as God would have you not for shameful gain but eagerly
not domineering over those in your charge but being examples to the flock
And when the chief Shepherd appears you will receive the unfading crown of glory
Likewise you who are younger be subject to the elders Clothe yourselves all of you with humility toward one another for God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble
Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you
casting all your anxieties on him because he cares for you
Be sober minded be watchful Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour
Resist him firm in your faith knowing that the same kinds of suffering are being experienced by your brotherhood throughout the world
And after you have suffered a little while the God of all grace who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ will himself restore confirm strengthen and establish you
To him be the dominion forever and ever Amen
By Silvanus a faithful brother as I regard him I have written briefly to you exhorting and declaring that this is the true grace of God Stand firm in it
She who is at Babylon who is likewise chosen sends you greetings and so does Mark my son
Greet one another with the kiss of love Peace to all of you who are in Christ
