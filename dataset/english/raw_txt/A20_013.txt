Proverbs 13
A wise son hears his father s instruction but a scoffer does not listen to rebuke
From the fruit of his mouth a man eats what is good but the desire of the treacherous is for violence
Whoever guards his mouth preserves his life he who opens wide his lips comes to ruin
The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing while the soul of the diligent is richly supplied
The righteous hates falsehood but the wicked brings shame and disgrace
Righteousness guards him whose way is blameless but sin overthrows the wicked
One pretends to be rich yet has nothing another pretends to be poor yet has great wealth
The ransom of a man s life is his wealth but a poor man hears no threat
The light of the righteous rejoices but the lamp of the wicked will be put out
By insolence comes nothing but strife but with those who take advice is wisdom
Wealth gained hastily will dwindle but whoever gathers little by little will increase it
Hope deferred makes the heart sick but a desire fulfilled is a tree of life
Whoever despises the word brings destruction on himself but he who reveres the commandment will be rewarded
The teaching of the wise is a fountain of life that one may turn away from the snares of death
Good sense wins favor but the way of the treacherous is their ruin
In everything the prudent acts with knowledge but a fool flaunts his folly
A wicked messenger falls into trouble but a faithful envoy brings healing
Poverty and disgrace come to him who ignores instruction but whoever heeds reproof is honored
A desire fulfilled is sweet to the soul but to turn away from evil is an abomination to fools
Whoever walks with the wise becomes wise but the companion of fools will suffer harm
Disaster pursues sinners but the righteous are rewarded with good
A good man leaves an inheritance to his children s children but the sinner s wealth is laid up for the righteous
The fallow ground of the poor would yield much food but it is swept away through injustice
Whoever spares the rod hates his son but he who loves him is diligent to discipline him
The righteous has enough to satisfy his appetite but the belly of the wicked suffers want
