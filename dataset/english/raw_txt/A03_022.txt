Leviticus 22
And the LORD spoke to Moses saying
Speak to Aaron and his sons so that they abstain from the holy things of the people of Israel which they dedicate to me so that they do not profane my holy name I am the LORD
Say to them If any one of all your offspring throughout your generations approaches the holy things that the people of Israel dedicate to the LORD while he has an uncleanness that person shall be cut off from my presence I am the LORD
None of the offspring of Aaron who has a leprous disease or a discharge may eat of the holy things until he is clean Whoever touches anything that is unclean through contact with the dead or a man who has had an emission of semen
and whoever touches a swarming thing by which he may be made unclean or a person from whom he may take uncleanness whatever his uncleanness may be
the person who touches such a thing shall be unclean until the evening and shall not eat of the holy things unless he has bathed his body in water
When the sun goes down he shall be clean and afterward he may eat of the holy things because they are his food
He shall not eat what dies of itself or is torn by beasts and so make himself unclean by it I am the LORD
They shall therefore keep my charge lest they bear sin for it and die thereby when they profane it I am the LORD who sanctifies them
A lay person shall not eat of a holy thing no foreign guest of the priest or hired servant shall eat of a holy thing
but if a priest buys a slave as his property for money the slave may eat of it and anyone born in his house may eat of his food
If a priest s daughter marries a layman she shall not eat of the contribution of the holy things
But if a priest s daughter is widowed or divorced and has no child and returns to her father s house as in her youth she may eat of her father s food yet no lay person shall eat of it
And if anyone eats of a holy thing unintentionally he shall add the fifth of its value to it and give the holy thing to the priest
They shall not profane the holy things of the people of Israel which they contribute to the LORD
and so cause them to bear iniquity and guilt by eating their holy things for I am the LORD who sanctifies them
And the LORD spoke to Moses saying
Speak to Aaron and his sons and all the people of Israel and say to them When any one of the house of Israel or of the sojourners in Israel presents a burnt offering as his offering for any of their vows or freewill offerings that they offer to the LORD
if it is to be accepted for you it shall be a male without blemish of the bulls or the sheep or the goats
You shall not offer anything that has a blemish for it will not be acceptable for you
And when anyone offers a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering from the herd or from the flock to be accepted it must be perfect there shall be no blemish in it
Animals blind or disabled or mutilated or having a discharge or an itch or scabs you shall not offer to the LORD or give them to the LORD as a food offering on the altar
You may present a bull or a lamb that has a part too long or too short for a freewill offering but for a vow offering it cannot be accepted
Any animal that has its testicles bruised or crushed or torn or cut you shall not offer to the LORD you shall not do it within your land
neither shall you offer as the bread of your God any such animals gotten from a foreigner Since there is a blemish in them because of their mutilation they will not be accepted for you
And the LORD spoke to Moses saying
When an ox or sheep or goat is born it shall remain seven days with its mother and from the eighth day on it shall be acceptable as a food offering to the LORD
But you shall not kill an ox or a sheep and her young in one day
And when you sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the LORD you shall sacrifice it so that you may be accepted
It shall be eaten on the same day you shall leave none of it until morning I am the LORD
So you shall keep my commandments and do them I am the LORD
And you shall not profane my holy name that I may be sanctified among the people of Israel I am the LORD who sanctifies you
who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God I am the LORD
