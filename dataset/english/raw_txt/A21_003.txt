Ecclesiastes 3
For everything there is a season and a time for every matter under heaven
a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up what is planted
a time to kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up
a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance
a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing
a time to seek and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to cast away
a time to tear and a time to sew a time to keep silence and a time to speak
a time to love and a time to hate a time for war and a time for peace
What gain has the worker from his toil
I have seen the business that God has given to the children of man to be busy with
He has made everything beautiful in its time Also he has put eternity into man s heart yet so that he cannot find out what God has done from the beginning to the end
I perceived that there is nothing better for them than to be joyful and to do good as long as they live
also that everyone should eat and drink and take pleasure in all his toil this is God s gift to man
I perceived that whatever God does endures forever nothing can be added to it nor anything taken from it God has done it so that people fear before him
That which is already has been that which is to be already has been and God seeks what has been driven away
Moreover I saw under the sun that in the place of justice even there was wickedness and in the place of righteousness even there was wickedness
I said in my heart God will judge the righteous and the wicked for there is a time for every matter and for every work
I said in my heart with regard to the children of man that God is testing them that they may see that they themselves are but beasts
For what happens to the children of man and what happens to the beasts is the same as one dies so dies the other They all have the same breath and man has no advantage over the beasts for all is vanity
All go to one place All are from the dust and to dust all return
Who knows whether the spirit of man goes upward and the spirit of the beast goes down into the earth
So I saw that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his work for that is his lot Who can bring him to see what will be after him
