Job 20
Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said
Therefore my thoughts answer me because of my haste within me
I hear censure that insults me and out of my understanding a spirit answers me
Do you not know this from of old since man was placed on earth
that the exulting of the wicked is short and the joy of the godless but for a moment
Though his height mount up to the heavens and his head reach to the clouds
he will perish forever like his own dung those who have seen him will say Where is he
He will fly away like a dream and not be found he will be chased away like a vision of the night
The eye that saw him will see him no more nor will his place any more behold him
His children will seek the favor of the poor and his hands will give back his wealth
His bones are full of his youthful vigor but it will lie down with him in the dust
Though evil is sweet in his mouth though he hides it under his tongue
though he is loath to let it go and holds it in his mouth
yet his food is turned in his stomach it is the venom of cobras within him
He swallows down riches and vomits them up again God casts them out of his belly
He will suck the poison of cobras the tongue of a viper will kill him
He will not look upon the rivers the streams flowing with honey and curds
He will give back the fruit of his toil and will not swallow it down from the profit of his trading he will get no enjoyment
For he has crushed and abandoned the poor he has seized a house that he did not build
Because he knew no contentment in his belly he will not let anything in which he delights escape him
There was nothing left after he had eaten therefore his prosperity will not endure
In the fullness of his sufficiency he will be in distress the hand of everyone in misery will come against him
To fill his belly to the full God will send his burning anger against him and rain it upon him into his body
He will flee from an iron weapon a bronze arrow will strike him through
It is drawn forth and comes out of his body the glittering point comes out of his gallbladder terrors come upon him
Utter darkness is laid up for his treasures a fire not fanned will devour him what is left in his tent will be consumed
The heavens will reveal his iniquity and the earth will rise up against him
The possessions of his house will be carried away dragged off in the day of God s wrath
This is the wicked man s portion from God the heritage decreed for him by God
