Isaiah 19
An oracle concerning Egypt Behold the LORD is riding on a swift cloud and comes to Egypt and the idols of Egypt will tremble at his presence and the heart of the Egyptians will melt within them
And I will stir up Egyptians against Egyptians and they will fight each against another and each against his neighbor city against city kingdom against kingdom
and the spirit of the Egyptians within them will be emptied out and I will confound their counsel and they will inquire of the idols and the sorcerers and the mediums and the necromancers
and I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a hard master and a fierce king will rule over them declares the Lord GOD of hosts
And the waters of the sea will be dried up and the river will be dry and parched
and its canals will become foul and the branches of Egypt s Nile will diminish and dry up reeds and rushes will rot away
There will be bare places by the Nile on the brink of the Nile and all that is sown by the Nile will be parched will be driven away and will be no more
The fishermen will mourn and lament all who cast a hook in the Nile and they will languish who spread nets on the water
The workers in combed flax will be in despair and the weavers of white cotton
Those who are the pillars of the land will be crushed and all who work for pay will be grieved
The princes of Zoan are utterly foolish the wisest counselors of Pharaoh give stupid counsel How can you say to Pharaoh I am a son of the wise a son of ancient kings
Where then are your wise men Let them tell you that they might know what the LORD of hosts has purposed against Egypt
The princes of Zoan have become fools and the princes of Memphis are deluded those who are the cornerstones of her tribes have made Egypt stagger
The LORD has mingled within her a spirit of confusion and they will make Egypt stagger in all its deeds as a drunken man staggers in his vomit
And there will be nothing for Egypt that head or tail palm branch or reed may do
In that day the Egyptians will be like women and tremble with fear before the hand that the LORD of hosts shakes over them
And the land of Judah will become a terror to the Egyptians Everyone to whom it is mentioned will fear because of the purpose that the LORD of hosts has purposed against them
In that day there will be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan and swear allegiance to the LORD of hosts One of these will be called the City of Destruction
In that day there will be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt and a pillar to the LORD at its border
It will be a sign and a witness to the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt When they cry to the LORD because of oppressors he will send them a savior and defender and deliver them
And the LORD will make himself known to the Egyptians and the Egyptians will know the LORD in that day and worship with sacrifice and offering and they will make vows to the LORD and perform them
And the LORD will strike Egypt striking and healing and they will return to the LORD and he will listen to their pleas for mercy and heal them
In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria and Assyria will come into Egypt and Egypt into Assyria and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians
In that day Israel will be the third with Egypt and Assyria a blessing in the midst of the earth
whom the LORD of hosts has blessed saying Blessed be Egypt my people and Assyria the work of my hands and Israel my inheritance
