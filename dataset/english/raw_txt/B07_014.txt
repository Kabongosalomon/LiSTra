1 Corienthians 14
Pursue love and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts especially that you may prophesy
For one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God for no one understands him but he utters mysteries in the Spirit
On the other hand the one who prophesies speaks to people for their upbuilding and encouragement and consolation
The one who speaks in a tongue builds up himself but the one who prophesies builds up the church
Now I want you all to speak in tongues but even more to prophesy The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues unless someone interprets so that the church may be built up
Now brothers if I come to you speaking in tongues how will I benefit you unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching
If even lifeless instruments such as the flute or the harp do not give distinct notes how will anyone know what is played
And if the bugle gives an indistinct sound who will get ready for battle
So with yourselves if with your tongue you utter speech that is not intelligible how will anyone know what is said For you will be speaking into the air
There are doubtless many different languages in the world and none is without meaning
but if I do not know the meaning of the language I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me
So with yourselves since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit strive to excel in building up the church
Therefore one who speaks in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret
For if I pray in a tongue my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful
What am I to do I will pray with my spirit but I will pray with my mind also I will sing praise with my spirit but I will sing with my mind also
Otherwise if you give thanks with your spirit how can anyone in the position of an outsider say Amen to your thanksgiving when he does not know what you are saying
For you may be giving thanks well enough but the other person is not being built up
I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you
Nevertheless in church I would rather speak five words with my mind in order to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue
Brothers do not be children in your thinking Be infants in evil but in your thinking be mature
In the Law it is written By people of strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners will I speak to this people and even then they will not listen to me says the Lord
Thus tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers while prophecy is a sign not for unbelievers but for believers
If therefore the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues and outsiders or unbelievers enter will they not say that you are out of your minds
But if all prophesy and an unbeliever or outsider enters he is convicted by all he is called to account by all
the secrets of his heart are disclosed and so falling on his face he will worship God and declare that God is really among you
What then brothers When you come together each one has a hymn a lesson a revelation a tongue or an interpretation Let all things be done for building up
If any speak in a tongue let there be only two or at most three and each in turn and let someone interpret
But if there is no one to interpret let each of them keep silent in church and speak to himself and to God
Let two or three prophets speak and let the others weigh what is said
If a revelation is made to another sitting there let the first be silent
For you can all prophesy one by one so that all may learn and all be encouraged
and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets
For God is not a God of confusion but of peace As in all the churches of the saints
the women should keep silent in the churches For they are not permitted to speak but should be in submission as the Law also says
If there is anything they desire to learn let them ask their husbands at home For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church
Or was it from you that the word of God came Or are you the only ones it has reached
If anyone thinks that he is a prophet or spiritual he should acknowledge that the things I am writing to you are a command of the Lord
If anyone does not recognize this he is not recognized
So my brothers earnestly desire to prophesy and do not forbid speaking in tongues
But all things should be done decently and in order
