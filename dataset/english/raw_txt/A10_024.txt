2 Samuel 24
Again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel and he incited David against them saying Go number Israel and Judah
So the king said to Joab the commander of the army who was with him Go through all the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beersheba and number the people that I may know the number of the people
But Joab said to the king May the LORD your God add to the people a hundred times as many as they are while the eyes of my lord the king still see it but why does my lord the king delight in this thing
But the king s word prevailed against Joab and the commanders of the army So Joab and the commanders of the army went out from the presence of the king to number the people of Israel
They crossed the Jordan and began from Aroer and from the city that is in the middle of the valley toward Gad and on to Jazer
Then they came to Gilead and to Kadesh in the land of the Hittites and they came to Dan and from Dan they went around to Sidon
and came to the fortress of Tyre and to all the cities of the Hivites and Canaanites and they went out to the Negeb of Judah at Beersheba
So when they had gone through all the land they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days
And Joab gave the sum of the numbering of the people to the king in Israel there were valiant men who drew the sword and the men of Judah were
But David s heart struck him after he had numbered the people And David said to the LORD I have sinned greatly in what I have done But now O LORD please take away the iniquity of your servant for I have done very foolishly
And when David arose in the morning the word of the LORD came to the prophet Gad David s seer saying
Go and say to David Thus says the LORD Three things I offer you Choose one of them that I may do it to you
So Gad came to David and told him and said to him Shall three years of famine come to you in your land Or will you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you Or shall there be three days pestilence in your land Now consider and decide what answer I shall return to him who sent me
Then David said to Gad I am in great distress Let us fall into the hand of the LORD for his mercy is great but let me not fall into the hand of man
So the LORD sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning until the appointed time And there died of the people from Dan to Beersheba men
And when the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it the LORD relented from the calamity and said to the angel who was working destruction among the people It is enough now stay your hand And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite
Then David spoke to the LORD when he saw the angel who was striking the people and said Behold I have sinned and I have done wickedly But these sheep what have they done Please let your hand be against me and against my father s house
And Gad came that day to David and said to him Go up raise an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite
So David went up at Gad s word as the LORD commanded
And when Araunah looked down he saw the king and his servants coming on toward him And Araunah went out and paid homage to the king with his face to the ground
And Araunah said Why has my lord the king come to his servant David said To buy the threshing floor from you in order to build an altar to the LORD that the plague may be averted from the people
Then Araunah said to David Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him Here are the oxen for the burnt offering and the threshing sledges and the yokes of the oxen for the wood
All this O king Araunah gives to the king And Araunah said to the king May the LORD your God accept you
But the king said to Araunah No but I will buy it from you for a price I will not offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God that cost me nothing So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver
And David built there an altar to the LORD and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings So the LORD responded to the plea for the land and the plague was averted from Israel
