Philippians 4
Therefore my brothers whom I love and long for my joy and crown stand firm thus in the Lord my beloved
I entreat Euodia and I entreat Syntyche to agree in the Lord
Yes I ask you also true companion help these women who have labored side by side with me in the gospel together with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers whose names are in the book of life
Rejoice in the Lord always again I will say Rejoice
Let your reasonableness be known to everyone The Lord is at hand
do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God
And the peace of God which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus
Finally brothers whatever is true whatever is honorable whatever is just whatever is pure whatever is lovely whatever is commendable if there is any excellence if there is anything worthy of praise think about these things
What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me practice these things and the God of peace will be with you
I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at length you have revived your concern for me You were indeed concerned for me but you had no opportunity
Not that I am speaking of being in need for I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content
I know how to be brought low and I know how to abound In any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger abundance and need
I can do all things through him who strengthens me
Yet it was kind of you to share my trouble
And you Philippians yourselves know that in the beginning of the gospel when I left Macedonia no church entered into partnership with me in giving and receiving except you only
Even in Thessalonica you sent me help for my needs once and again
Not that I seek the gift but I seek the fruit that increases to your credit
I have received full payment and more I am well supplied having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent a fragrant offering a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God
And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus
To our God and Father be glory forever and ever Amen
Greet every saint in Christ Jesus The brothers who are with me greet you
All the saints greet you especially those of Caesar s household
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit
