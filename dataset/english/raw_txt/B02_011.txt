Mark 11
Now when they drew near to Jerusalem to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives Jesus sent two of his disciples
and said to them Go into the village in front of you and immediately as you enter it you will find a colt tied on which no one has ever sat Untie it and bring it
If anyone says to you Why are you doing this say The Lord has need of it and will send it back here immediately
And they went away and found a colt tied at a door outside in the street and they untied it
And some of those standing there said to them What are you doing untying the colt
And they told them what Jesus had said and they let them go
And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks on it and he sat on it
And many spread their cloaks on the road and others spread leafy branches that they had cut from the fields
And those who went before and those who followed were shouting Hosanna Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord
Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David Hosanna in the highest
And he entered Jerusalem and went into the temple And when he had looked around at everything as it was already late he went out to Bethany with the twelve
On the following day when they came from Bethany he was hungry
And seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf he went to see if he could find anything on it When he came to it he found nothing but leaves for it was not the season for figs
And he said to it May no one ever eat fruit from you again And his disciples heard it
And they came to Jerusalem And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold and those who bought in the temple and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons
And he would not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple
And he was teaching them and saying to them Is it not written My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations But you have made it a den of robbers
And the chief priests and the scribes heard it and were seeking a way to destroy him for they feared him because all the crowd was astonished at his teaching
And when evening came they went out of the city
As they passed by in the morning they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots
And Peter remembered and said to him Rabbi look The fig tree that you cursed has withered
And Jesus answered them Have faith in God
Truly I say to you whoever says to this mountain Be taken up and thrown into the sea and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will come to pass it will be done for him
Therefore I tell you whatever you ask in prayer believe that you have received it and it will be yours
And whenever you stand praying forgive if you have anything against anyone so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses
And they came again to Jerusalem And as he was walking in the temple the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to him
and they said to him By what authority are you doing these things or who gave you this authority to do them
Jesus said to them I will ask you one question answer me and I will tell you by what authority I do these things
Was the baptism of John from heaven or from man Answer me
And they discussed it with one another saying If we say From heaven he will say Why then did you not believe him
But shall we say From man they were afraid of the people for they all held that John really was a prophet
So they answered Jesus We do not know And Jesus said to them Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things
