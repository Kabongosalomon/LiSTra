Judges 15
After some days at the time of wheat harvest Samson went to visit his wife with a young goat And he said I will go in to my wife in the chamber But her father would not allow him to go in
And her father said I really thought that you utterly hated her so I gave her to your companion Is not her younger sister more beautiful than she Please take her instead
And Samson said to them This time I shall be innocent in regard to the Philistines when I do them harm
So Samson went and caught foxes and took torches And he turned them tail to tail and put a torch between each pair of tails
And when he had set fire to the torches he let the foxes go into the standing grain of the Philistines and set fire to the stacked grain and the standing grain as well as the olive orchards
Then the Philistines said Who has done this And they said Samson the son in law of the Timnite because he has taken his wife and given her to his companion And the Philistines came up and burned her and her father with fire
And Samson said to them If this is what you do I swear I will be avenged on you and after that I will quit
And he struck them hip and thigh with a great blow and he went down and stayed in the cleft of the rock of Etam
Then the Philistines came up and encamped in Judah and made a raid on Lehi
And the men of Judah said Why have you come up against us They said We have come up to bind Samson to do to him as he did to us
Then men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam and said to Samson Do you not know that the Philistines are rulers over us What then is this that you have done to us And he said to them As they did to me so have I done to them
And they said to him We have come down to bind you that we may give you into the hands of the Philistines And Samson said to them Swear to me that you will not attack me yourselves
They said to him No we will only bind you and give you into their hands We will surely not kill you So they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock
When he came to Lehi the Philistines came shouting to meet him Then the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon him and the ropes that were on his arms became as flax that has caught fire and his bonds melted off his hands
And he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey and put out his hand and took it and with it he struck men
And Samson said With the jawbone of a donkey heaps upon heaps with the jawbone of a donkey have I struck down a thousand men
As soon as he had finished speaking he threw away the jawbone out of his hand And that place was called Ramath lehi
And he was very thirsty and he called upon the LORD and said You have granted this great salvation by the hand of your servant and shall I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised
And God split open the hollow place that is at Lehi and water came out from it And when he drank his spirit returned and he revived Therefore the name of it was called En hakkore it is at Lehi to this day
And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years
