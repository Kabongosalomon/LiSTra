Acts 25
Now three days after Festus had arrived in the province he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea
And the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews laid out their case against Paul and they urged him
asking as a favor against Paul that he summon him to Jerusalem because they were planning an ambush to kill him on the way
Festus replied that Paul was being kept at Caesarea and that he himself intended to go there shortly
So said he let the men of authority among you go down with me and if there is anything wrong about the man let them bring charges against him
After he stayed among them not more than eight or ten days he went down to Caesarea And the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought
When he had arrived the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him bringing many and serious charges against him that they could not prove
Paul argued in his defense Neither against the law of the Jews nor against the temple nor against Caesar have I committed any offense
But Festus wishing to do the Jews a favor said to Paul Do you wish to go up to Jerusalem and there be tried on these charges before me
But Paul said I am standing before Caesar s tribunal where I ought to be tried To the Jews I have done no wrong as you yourself know very well
If then I am a wrongdoer and have committed anything for which I deserve to die I do not seek to escape death But if there is nothing to their charges against me no one can give me up to them I appeal to Caesar
Then Festus when he had conferred with his council answered To Caesar you have appealed to Caesar you shall go
Now when some days had passed Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea and greeted Festus
And as they stayed there many days Festus laid Paul s case before the king saying There is a man left prisoner by Felix
and when I was at Jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the Jews laid out their case against him asking for a sentence of condemnation against him
I answered them that it was not the custom of the Romans to give up anyone before the accused met the accusers face to face and had opportunity to make his defense concerning the charge laid against him
So when they came together here I made no delay but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought
When the accusers stood up they brought no charge in his case of such evils as I supposed
Rather they had certain points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus who was dead but whom Paul asserted to be alive
Being at a loss how to investigate these questions I asked whether he wanted to go to Jerusalem and be tried there regarding them
But when Paul had appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of the emperor I ordered him to be held until I could send him to Caesar
Then Agrippa said to Festus I would like to hear the man myself Tomorrow said he you will hear him
So on the next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and they entered the audience hall with the military tribunes and the prominent men of the city Then at the command of Festus Paul was brought in
And Festus said King Agrippa and all who are present with us you see this man about whom the whole Jewish people petitioned me both in Jerusalem and here shouting that he ought not to live any longer
But I found that he had done nothing deserving death And as he himself appealed to the emperor I decided to go ahead and send him
But I have nothing definite to write to my lord about him Therefore I have brought him before you all and especially before you King Agrippa so that after we have examined him I may have something to write
For it seems to me unreasonable in sending a prisoner not to indicate the charges against him
