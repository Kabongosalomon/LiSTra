Job 31
I have made a covenant with my eyes how then could I gaze at a virgin
What would be my portion from God above and my heritage from the Almighty on high
Is not calamity for the unrighteous and disaster for the workers of iniquity
Does not he see my ways and number all my steps
If I have walked with falsehood and my foot has hastened to deceit
Let me be weighed in a just balance and let God know my integrity
if my step has turned aside from the way and my heart has gone after my eyes and if any spot has stuck to my hands
then let me sow and another eat and let what grows for me be rooted out
If my heart has been enticed toward a woman and I have lain in wait at my neighbor s door
then let my wife grind for another and let others bow down on her
For that would be a heinous crime that would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges
for that would be a fire that consumes as far as Abaddon and it would burn to the root all my increase
If I have rejected the cause of my manservant or my maidservant when they brought a complaint against me
what then shall I do when God rises up When he makes inquiry what shall I answer him
Did not he who made me in the womb make him And did not one fashion us in the womb
If I have withheld anything that the poor desired or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail
or have eaten my morsel alone and the fatherless has not eaten of it
for from my youth the fatherless grew up with me as with a father and from my mother s womb I guided the widow
if I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing or the needy without covering
if his body has not blessed me and if he was not warmed with the fleece of my sheep
if I have raised my hand against the fatherless because I saw my help in the gate
then let my shoulder blade fall from my shoulder and let my arm be broken from its socket
For I was in terror of calamity from God and I could not have faced his majesty
If I have made gold my trust or called fine gold my confidence
if I have rejoiced because my wealth was abundant or because my hand had found much
if I have looked at the sun when it shone or the moon moving in splendor
and my heart has been secretly enticed and my mouth has kissed my hand
this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges for I would have been false to God above
If I have rejoiced at the ruin of him who hated me or exulted when evil overtook him
I have not let my mouth sin by asking for his life with a curse
if the men of my tent have not said Who is there that has not been filled with his meat
the sojourner has not lodged in the street I have opened my doors to the traveler
if I have concealed my transgressions as others do by hiding my iniquity in my bosom
because I stood in great fear of the multitude and the contempt of families terrified me so that I kept silence and did not go out of doors
Oh that I had one to hear me Here is my signature Let the Almighty answer me Oh that I had the indictment written by my adversary
Surely I would carry it on my shoulder I would bind it on me as a crown
I would give him an account of all my steps like a prince I would approach him
If my land has cried out against me and its furrows have wept together
if I have eaten its yield without payment and made its owners breathe their last
let thorns grow instead of wheat and foul weeds instead of barley The words of Job are ended
