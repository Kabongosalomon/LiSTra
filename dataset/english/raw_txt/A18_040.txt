Job 40
And the LORD said to Job
Shall a faultfinder contend with the Almighty He who argues with God let him answer it
Then Job answered the LORD and said
Behold I am of small account what shall I answer you I lay my hand on my mouth
I have spoken once and I will not answer twice but I will proceed no further
Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said
Dress for action like a man I will question you and you make it known to me
Will you even put me in the wrong Will you condemn me that you may be in the right
Have you an arm like God and can you thunder with a voice like his
Adorn yourself with majesty and dignity clothe yourself with glory and splendor
Pour out the overflowings of your anger and look on everyone who is proud and abase him
Look on everyone who is proud and bring him low and tread down the wicked where they stand
Hide them all in the dust together bind their faces in the world below
Then will I also acknowledge to you that your own right hand can save you
Behold Behemoth which I made as I made you he eats grass like an ox
Behold his strength in his loins and his power in the muscles of his belly
He makes his tail stiff like a cedar the sinews of his thighs are knit together
His bones are tubes of bronze his limbs like bars of iron
He is the first of the works of God let him who made him bring near his sword
For the mountains yield food for him where all the wild beasts play
Under the lotus plants he lies in the shelter of the reeds and in the marsh
For his shade the lotus trees cover him the willows of the brook surround him
Behold if the river is turbulent he is not frightened he is confident though Jordan rushes against his mouth
Can one take him by his eyes or pierce his nose with a snare
