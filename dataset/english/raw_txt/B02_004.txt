Mark 4
Again he began to teach beside the sea And a very large crowd gathered about him so that he got into a boat and sat in it on the sea and the whole crowd was beside the sea on the land
And he was teaching them many things in parables and in his teaching he said to them
Listen A sower went out to sow
And as he sowed some seed fell along the path and the birds came and devoured it
Other seed fell on rocky ground where it did not have much soil and immediately it sprang up since it had no depth of soil
And when the sun rose it was scorched and since it had no root it withered away
Other seed fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it and it yielded no grain
And other seeds fell into good soil and produced grain growing up and increasing and yielding thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold
And he said He who has ears to hear let him hear
And when he was alone those around him with the twelve asked him about the parables
And he said to them To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God but for those outside everything is in parables
so that they may indeed see but not perceive and may indeed hear but not understand lest they should turn and be forgiven
And he said to them Do you not understand this parable How then will you understand all the parables
The sower sows the word
And these are the ones along the path where the word is sown when they hear Satan immediately comes and takes away the word that is sown in them
And these are the ones sown on rocky ground the ones who when they hear the word immediately receive it with joy
And they have no root in themselves but endure for a while then when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word immediately they fall away
And others are the ones sown among thorns They are those who hear the word
but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word and it proves unfruitful
But those that were sown on the good soil are the ones who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold
And he said to them Is a lamp brought in to be put under a basket or under a bed and not on a stand
For nothing is hidden except to be made manifest nor is anything secret except to come to light
If anyone has ears to hear let him hear
And he said to them Pay attention to what you hear with the measure you use it will be measured to you and still more will be added to you
For to the one who has more will be given and from the one who has not even what he has will be taken away
And he said The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground
He sleeps and rises night and day and the seed sprouts and grows he knows not how
The earth produces by itself first the blade then the ear then the full grain in the ear
But when the grain is ripe at once he puts in the sickle because the harvest has come
And he said With what can we compare the kingdom of God or what parable shall we use for it
It is like a grain of mustard seed which when sown on the ground is the smallest of all the seeds on earth
yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden plants and puts out large branches so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade
With many such parables he spoke the word to them as they were able to hear it
He did not speak to them without a parable but privately to his own disciples he explained everything
On that day when evening had come he said to them Let us go across to the other side
And leaving the crowd they took him with them in the boat just as he was And other boats were with him
And a great windstorm arose and the waves were breaking into the boat so that the boat was already filling
But he was in the stern asleep on the cushion And they woke him and said to him Teacher do you not care that we are perishing
And he awoke and rebuked the wind and said to the sea Peace Be still And the wind ceased and there was a great calm
He said to them Why are you so afraid Have you still no faith
And they were filled with great fear and said to one another Who then is this that even the wind and the sea obey him
