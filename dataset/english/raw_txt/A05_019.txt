Deuteronomy 19
When the LORD your God cuts off the nations whose land the LORD your God is giving you and you dispossess them and dwell in their cities and in their houses
you shall set apart three cities for yourselves in the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess
You shall measure the distances and divide into three parts the area of the land that the LORD your God gives you as a possession so that any manslayer can flee to them
This is the provision for the manslayer who by fleeing there may save his life If anyone kills his neighbor unintentionally without having hated him in the past
as when someone goes into the forest with his neighbor to cut wood and his hand swings the axe to cut down a tree and the head slips from the handle and strikes his neighbor so that he dies he may flee to one of these cities and live
lest the avenger of blood in hot anger pursue the manslayer and overtake him because the way is long and strike him fatally though the man did not deserve to die since he had not hated his neighbor in the past
Therefore I command you You shall set apart three cities
And if the LORD your God enlarges your territory as he has sworn to your fathers and gives you all the land that he promised to give to your fathers
provided you are careful to keep all this commandment which I command you today by loving the LORD your God and by walking ever in his ways then you shall add three other cities to these three
lest innocent blood be shed in your land that the LORD your God is giving you for an inheritance and so the guilt of bloodshed be upon you
But if anyone hates his neighbor and lies in wait for him and attacks him and strikes him fatally so that he dies and he flees into one of these cities
then the elders of his city shall send and take him from there and hand him over to the avenger of blood so that he may die
Your eye shall not pity him but you shall purge the guilt of innocent blood from Israel so that it may be well with you
You shall not move your neighbor s landmark which the men of old have set in the inheritance that you will hold in the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess
A single witness shall not suffice against a person for any crime or for any wrong in connection with any offense that he has committed Only on the evidence of two witnesses or of three witnesses shall a charge be established
If a malicious witness arises to accuse a person of wrongdoing
then both parties to the dispute shall appear before the LORD before the priests and the judges who are in office in those days
The judges shall inquire diligently and if the witness is a false witness and has accused his brother falsely
then you shall do to him as he had meant to do to his brother So you shall purge the evil from your midst
And the rest shall hear and fear and shall never again commit any such evil among you
Your eye shall not pity It shall be life for life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot
