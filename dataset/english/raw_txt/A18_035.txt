Job 35
And Elihu answered and said
Do you think this to be just Do you say It is my right before God
that you ask What advantage have I How am I better off than if I had sinned
I will answer you and your friends with you
Look at the heavens and see and behold the clouds which are higher than you
If you have sinned what do you accomplish against him And if your transgressions are multiplied what do you do to him
If you are righteous what do you give to him Or what does he receive from your hand
Your wickedness concerns a man like yourself and your righteousness a son of man
Because of the multitude of oppressions people cry out they call for help because of the arm of the mighty
But none says Where is God my Maker who gives songs in the night
who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens
There they cry out but he does not answer because of the pride of evil men
Surely God does not hear an empty cry nor does the Almighty regard it
How much less when you say that you do not see him that the case is before him and you are waiting for him
And now because his anger does not punish and he does not take much note of transgression
Job opens his mouth in empty talk he multiplies words without knowledge
