Ecclesiastes 10
Dead flies make the perfumer s ointment give off a stench so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor
A wise man s heart inclines him to the right but a fool s heart to the left
Even when the fool walks on the road he lacks sense and he says to everyone that he is a fool
If the anger of the ruler rises against you do not leave your place for calmness will lay great offenses to rest
There is an evil that I have seen under the sun as it were an error proceeding from the ruler
folly is set in many high places and the rich sit in a low place
I have seen slaves on horses and princes walking on the ground like slaves
He who digs a pit will fall into it and a serpent will bite him who breaks through a wall
He who quarries stones is hurt by them and he who splits logs is endangered by them
If the iron is blunt and one does not sharpen the edge he must use more strength but wisdom helps one to succeed
If the serpent bites before it is charmed there is no advantage to the charmer
The words of a wise man s mouth win him favor but the lips of a fool consume him
The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness and the end of his talk is evil madness
A fool multiplies words though no man knows what is to be and who can tell him what will be after him
The toil of a fool wearies him for he does not know the way to the city
Woe to you O land when your king is a child and your princes feast in the morning
Happy are you O land when your king is the son of the nobility and your princes feast at the proper time for strength and not for drunkenness
Through sloth the roof sinks in and through indolence the house leaks
Bread is made for laughter and wine gladdens life and money answers everything
Even in your thoughts do not curse the king nor in your bedroom curse the rich for a bird of the air will carry your voice or some winged creature tell the matter
