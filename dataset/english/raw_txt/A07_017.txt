Judges 17
There was a man of the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Micah
And he said to his mother The pieces of silver that were taken from you about which you uttered a curse and also spoke it in my ears behold the silver is with me I took it And his mother said Blessed be my son by the LORD
And he restored the pieces of silver to his mother And his mother said I dedicate the silver to the LORD from my hand for my son to make a carved image and a metal image Now therefore I will restore it to you
So when he restored the money to his mother his mother took pieces of silver and gave it to the silversmith who made it into a carved image and a metal image And it was in the house of Micah
And the man Micah had a shrine and he made an ephod and household gods and ordained one of his sons who became his priest
In those days there was no king in Israel Everyone did what was right in his own eyes
Now there was a young man of Bethlehem in Judah of the family of Judah who was a Levite and he sojourned there
And the man departed from the town of Bethlehem in Judah to sojourn where he could find a place And as he journeyed he came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah
And Micah said to him Where do you come from And he said to him I am a Levite of Bethlehem in Judah and I am going to sojourn where I may find a place
And Micah said to him Stay with me and be to me a father and a priest and I will give you ten pieces of silver a year and a suit of clothes and your living And the Levite went in
And the Levite was content to dwell with the man and the young man became to him like one of his sons
And Micah ordained the Levite and the young man became his priest and was in the house of Micah
Then Micah said Now I know that the LORD will prosper me because I have a Levite as priest
