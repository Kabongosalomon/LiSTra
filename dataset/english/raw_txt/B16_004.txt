2 Timothy 4
I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus who is to judge the living and the dead and by his appearing and his kingdom
preach the word be ready in season and out of season reprove rebuke and exhort with complete patience and teaching
For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions
and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths
As for you always be sober minded endure suffering do the work of an evangelist fulfill your ministry
For I am already being poured out as a drink offering and the time of my departure has come
I have fought the good fight I have finished the race I have kept the faith
Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge will award to me on that Day and not only to me but also to all who have loved his appearing
Do your best to come to me soon
For Demas in love with this present world has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica Crescens has gone to Galatia Titus to Dalmatia
Luke alone is with me Get Mark and bring him with you for he is very useful to me for ministry
Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus
When you come bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas also the books and above all the parchments
Alexander the coppersmith did me great harm the Lord will repay him according to his deeds
Beware of him yourself for he strongly opposed our message
At my first defense no one came to stand by me but all deserted me May it not be charged against them
But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it So I was rescued from the lion s mouth
The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed and bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom To him be the glory forever and ever Amen
Greet Prisca and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus
Erastus remained at Corinth and I left Trophimus who was ill at Miletus
Do your best to come before winter Eubulus sends greetings to you as do Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brothers
The Lord be with your spirit Grace be with you
