Job 33
But now hear my speech O Job and listen to all my words
Behold I open my mouth the tongue in my mouth speaks
My words declare the uprightness of my heart and what my lips know they speak sincerely
The Spirit of God has made me and the breath of the Almighty gives me life
Answer me if you can set your words in order before me take your stand
Behold I am toward God as you are I too was pinched off from a piece of clay
Behold no fear of me need terrify you my pressure will not be heavy upon you
Surely you have spoken in my ears and I have heard the sound of your words
You say I am pure without transgression I am clean and there is no iniquity in me
Behold he finds occasions against me he counts me as his enemy
he puts my feet in the stocks and watches all my paths
Behold in this you are not right I will answer you for God is greater than man
Why do you contend against him saying He will answer none of man s words
For God speaks in one way and in two though man does not perceive it
In a dream in a vision of the night when deep sleep falls on men while they slumber on their beds
then he opens the ears of men and terrifies them with warnings
that he may turn man aside from his deed and conceal pride from a man
he keeps back his soul from the pit his life from perishing by the sword
Man is also rebuked with pain on his bed and with continual strife in his bones
so that his life loathes bread and his appetite the choicest food
His flesh is so wasted away that it cannot be seen and his bones that were not seen stick out
His soul draws near the pit and his life to those who bring death
If there be for him an angel a mediator one of the thousand to declare to man what is right for him
and he is merciful to him and says Deliver him from going down into the pit I have found a ransom
let his flesh become fresh with youth let him return to the days of his youthful vigor
then man prays to God and he accepts him he sees his face with a shout of joy and he restores to man his righteousness
He sings before men and says I sinned and perverted what was right and it was not repaid to me
He has redeemed my soul from going down into the pit and my life shall look upon the light
Behold God does all these things twice three times with a man
to bring back his soul from the pit that he may be lighted with the light of life
Pay attention O Job listen to me be silent and I will speak
If you have any words answer me speak for I desire to justify you
If not listen to me be silent and I will teach you wisdom
