Isaiah 51
Listen to me you who pursue righteousness you who seek the LORD look to the rock from which you were hewn and to the quarry from which you were dug
Look to Abraham your father and to Sarah who bore you for he was but one when I called him that I might bless him and multiply him
For the LORD comforts Zion he comforts all her waste places and makes her wilderness like Eden her desert like the garden of the LORD joy and gladness will be found in her thanksgiving and the voice of song
Give attention to me my people and give ear to me my nation for a law will go out from me and I will set my justice for a light to the peoples
My righteousness draws near my salvation has gone out and my arms will judge the peoples the coastlands hope for me and for my arm they wait
Lift up your eyes to the heavens and look at the earth beneath for the heavens vanish like smoke the earth will wear out like a garment and they who dwell in it will die in like manner but my salvation will be forever and my righteousness will never be dismayed
Listen to me you who know righteousness the people in whose heart is my law fear not the reproach of man nor be dismayed at their revilings
For the moth will eat them up like a garment and the worm will eat them like wool but my righteousness will be forever and my salvation to all generations
Awake awake put on strength O arm of the LORD awake as in days of old the generations of long ago Was it not you who cut Rahab in pieces who pierced the dragon
Was it not you who dried up the sea the waters of the great deep who made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over
And the ransomed of the LORD shall return and come to Zion with singing everlasting joy shall be upon their heads they shall obtain gladness and joy and sorrow and sighing shall flee away
I I am he who comforts you who are you that you are afraid of man who dies of the son of man who is made like grass
and have forgotten the LORD your Maker who stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth and you fear continually all the day because of the wrath of the oppressor when he sets himself to destroy And where is the wrath of the oppressor
He who is bowed down shall speedily be released he shall not die and go down to the pit neither shall his bread be lacking
I am the LORD your God who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar the LORD of hosts is his name
And I have put my words in your mouth and covered you in the shadow of my hand establishing the heavens and laying the foundations of the earth and saying to Zion You are my people
Wake yourself wake yourself stand up O Jerusalem you who have drunk from the hand of the LORD the cup of his wrath who have drunk to the dregs the bowl the cup of staggering
There is none to guide her among all the sons she has borne there is none to take her by the hand among all the sons she has brought up
These two things have happened to you who will console you devastation and destruction famine and sword who will comfort you
Your sons have fainted they lie at the head of every street like an antelope in a net they are full of the wrath of the LORD the rebuke of your God
Therefore hear this you who are afflicted who are drunk but not with wine
Thus says your Lord the LORD your God who pleads the cause of his people Behold I have taken from your hand the cup of staggering the bowl of my wrath you shall drink no more
and I will put it into the hand of your tormentors who have said to you Bow down that we may pass over and you have made your back like the ground and like the street for them to pass over
