2 Thessalonians 3
Finally brothers pray for us that the word of the Lord may speed ahead and be honored as happened among you
and that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men For not all have faith
But the Lord is faithful He will establish you and guard you against the evil one
And we have confidence in the Lord about you that you are doing and will do the things that we command
May the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God and to the steadfastness of Christ
Now we command you brothers in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you keep away from any brother who is walking in idleness and not in accord with the tradition that you received from us
For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us because we were not idle when we were with you
nor did we eat anyone s bread without paying for it but with toil and labor we worked night and day that we might not be a burden to any of you
It was not because we do not have that right but to give you in ourselves an example to imitate
For even when we were with you we would give you this command If anyone is not willing to work let him not eat
For we hear that some among you walk in idleness not busy at work but busybodies
Now such persons we command and encourage in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living
As for you brothers do not grow weary in doing good
If anyone does not obey what we say in this letter take note of that person and have nothing to do with him that he may be ashamed
Do not regard him as an enemy but warn him as a brother
Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in every way The Lord be with you all
I Paul write this greeting with my own hand This is the sign of genuineness in every letter of mine it is the way I write
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all
