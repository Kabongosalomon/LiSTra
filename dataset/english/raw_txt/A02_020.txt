Exodus 20
And God spoke all these words saying
I am the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt out of the house of slavery
You shall have no other gods before me
You shall not make for yourself a carved image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth
You shall not bow down to them or serve them for I the LORD your God am a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me
but showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments
You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain for the LORD will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain
Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy
Six days you shall labor and do all your work
but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God On it you shall not do any work you or your son or your daughter your male servant or your female servant or your livestock or the sojourner who is within your gates
For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth the sea and all that is in them and rested on the seventh day Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy
Honor your father and your mother that your days may be long in the land that the LORD your God is giving you
You shall not murder
You shall not commit adultery
You shall not steal
You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor
You shall not covet your neighbor s house you shall not covet your neighbor s wife or his male servant or his female servant or his ox or his donkey or anything that is your neighbor s
Now when all the people saw the thunder and the flashes of lightning and the sound of the trumpet and the mountain smoking the people were afraid and trembled and they stood far off
and said to Moses You speak to us and we will listen but do not let God speak to us lest we die
Moses said to the people Do not fear for God has come to test you that the fear of him may be before you that you may not sin
The people stood far off while Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was
And the LORD said to Moses Thus you shall say to the people of Israel You have seen for yourselves that I have talked with you from heaven
You shall not make gods of silver to be with me nor shall you make for yourselves gods of gold
An altar of earth you shall make for me and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings your sheep and your oxen In every place where I cause my name to be remembered I will come to you and bless you
If you make me an altar of stone you shall not build it of hewn stones for if you wield your tool on it you profane it
And you shall not go up by steps to my altar that your nakedness be not exposed on it
