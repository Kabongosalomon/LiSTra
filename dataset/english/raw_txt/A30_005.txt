Amos 5
Hear this word that I take up over you in lamentation O house of Israel
Fallen no more to rise is the virgin Israel forsaken on her land with none to raise her up
For thus says the Lord GOD The city that went out a thousand shall have a hundred left and that which went out a hundred shall have ten left to the house of Israel
For thus says the LORD to the house of Israel Seek me and live
but do not seek Bethel and do not enter into Gilgal or cross over to Beersheba for Gilgal shall surely go into exile and Bethel shall come to nothing
Seek the LORD and live lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph and it devour with none to quench it for Bethel
O you who turn justice to wormwood and cast down righteousness to the earth
He who made the Pleiades and Orion and turns deep darkness into the morning and darkens the day into night who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out on the surface of the earth the LORD is his name
who makes destruction flash forth against the strong so that destruction comes upon the fortress
They hate him who reproves in the gate and they abhor him who speaks the truth
Therefore because you trample on the poor and you exact taxes of grain from him you have built houses of hewn stone but you shall not dwell in them you have planted pleasant vineyards but you shall not drink their wine
For I know how many are your transgressions and how great are your sins you who afflict the righteous who take a bribe and turn aside the needy in the gate
Therefore he who is prudent will keep silent in such a time for it is an evil time
Seek good and not evil that you may live and so the LORD the God of hosts will be with you as you have said
Hate evil and love good and establish justice in the gate it may be that the LORD the God of hosts will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph
Therefore thus says the LORD the God of hosts the Lord In all the squares there shall be wailing and in all the streets they shall say Alas Alas They shall call the farmers to mourning and to wailing those who are skilled in lamentation
and in all vineyards there shall be wailing for I will pass through your midst says the LORD
Woe to you who desire the day of the LORD Why would you have the day of the LORD It is darkness and not light
as if a man fled from a lion and a bear met him or went into the house and leaned his hand against the wall and a serpent bit him
Is not the day of the LORD darkness and not light and gloom with no brightness in it
I hate I despise your feasts and I take no delight in your solemn assemblies
Even though you offer me your burnt offerings and grain offerings I will not accept them and the peace offerings of your fattened animals I will not look upon them
Take away from me the noise of your songs to the melody of your harps I will not listen
But let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever flowing stream
Did you bring to me sacrifices and offerings during the forty years in the wilderness O house of Israel
You shall take up Sikkuth your king and Kiyyun your star god your images that you made for yourselves
and I will send you into exile beyond Damascus says the LORD whose name is the God of hosts
