Numbers 23
And Balaam said to Balak Build for me here seven altars and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams
Balak did as Balaam had said And Balak and Balaam offered on each altar a bull and a ram
And Balaam said to Balak Stand beside your burnt offering and I will go Perhaps the LORD will come to meet me and whatever he shows me I will tell you And he went to a bare height
and God met Balaam And Balaam said to him I have arranged the seven altars and I have offered on each altar a bull and a ram
And the LORD put a word in Balaam s mouth and said Return to Balak and thus you shall speak
And he returned to him and behold he and all the princes of Moab were standing beside his burnt offering
And Balaam took up his discourse and said From Aram Balak has brought me the king of Moab from the eastern mountains Come curse Jacob for me and come denounce Israel
How can I curse whom God has not cursed How can I denounce whom the LORD has not denounced
For from the top of the crags I see him from the hills I behold him behold a people dwelling alone and not counting itself among the nations
Who can count the dust of Jacob or number the fourth part of Israel Let me die the death of the upright and let my end be like his
And Balak said to Balaam What have you done to me I took you to curse my enemies and behold you have done nothing but bless them
And he answered and said Must I not take care to speak what the LORD puts in my mouth
And Balak said to him Please come with me to another place from which you may see them You shall see only a fraction of them and shall not see them all Then curse them for me from there
And he took him to the field of Zophim to the top of Pisgah and built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar
Balaam said to Balak Stand here beside your burnt offering while I meet the LORD over there
And the LORD met Balaam and put a word in his mouth and said Return to Balak and thus shall you speak
And he came to him and behold he was standing beside his burnt offering and the princes of Moab with him And Balak said to him What has the LORD spoken
And Balaam took up his discourse and said Rise Balak and hear give ear to me O son of Zippor
God is not man that he should lie or a son of man that he should change his mind Has he said and will he not do it Or has he spoken and will he not fulfill it
Behold I received a command to bless he has blessed and I cannot revoke it
He has not beheld misfortune in Jacob nor has he seen trouble in Israel The LORD their God is with them and the shout of a king is among them
God brings them out of Egypt and is for them like the horns of the wild ox
For there is no enchantment against Jacob no divination against Israel now it shall be said of Jacob and Israel What has God wrought
Behold a people As a lioness it rises up and as a lion it lifts itself it does not lie down until it has devoured the prey and drunk the blood of the slain
And Balak said to Balaam Do not curse them at all and do not bless them at all
But Balaam answered Balak Did I not tell you All that the LORD says that I must do
And Balak said to Balaam Come now I will take you to another place Perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there
So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor which overlooks the desert
And Balaam said to Balak Build for me here seven altars and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams
And Balak did as Balaam had said and offered a bull and a ram on each altar
