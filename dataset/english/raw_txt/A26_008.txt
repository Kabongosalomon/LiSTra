Ezekiel 8
In the sixth year in the sixth month on the fifth day of the month as I sat in my house with the elders of Judah sitting before me the hand of the Lord GOD fell upon me there
Then I looked and behold a form that had the appearance of a man Below what appeared to be his waist was fire and above his waist was something like the appearance of brightness like gleaming metal
He put out the form of a hand and took me by a lock of my head and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and brought me in visions of God to Jerusalem to the entrance of the gateway of the inner court that faces north where was the seat of the image of jealousy which provokes to jealousy
And behold the glory of the God of Israel was there like the vision that I saw in the valley
Then he said to me Son of man lift up your eyes now toward the north So I lifted up my eyes toward the north and behold north of the altar gate in the entrance was this image of jealousy
And he said to me Son of man do you see what they are doing the great abominations that the house of Israel are committing here to drive me far from my sanctuary But you will see still greater abominations
And he brought me to the entrance of the court and when I looked behold there was a hole in the wall
Then he said to me Son of man dig in the wall So I dug in the wall and behold there was an entrance
And he said to me Go in and see the vile abominations that they are committing here
So I went in and saw And there engraved on the wall all around was every form of creeping things and loathsome beasts and all the idols of the house of Israel
And before them stood seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel with Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan standing among them Each had his censer in his hand and the smoke of the cloud of incense went up
Then he said to me Son of man have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the dark each in his room of pictures For they say The LORD does not see us the LORD has forsaken the land
He said also to me You will see still greater abominations that they commit
Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of the LORD and behold there sat women weeping for Tammuz
Then he said to me Have you seen this O son of man You will see still greater abominations than these
And he brought me into the inner court of the house of the LORD And behold at the entrance of the temple of the LORD between the porch and the altar were about twenty five men with their backs to the temple of the LORD and their faces toward the east worshiping the sun toward the east
Then he said to me Have you seen this O son of man Is it too light a thing for the house of Judah to commit the abominations that they commit here that they should fill the land with violence and provoke me still further to anger Behold they put the branch to their nose
Therefore I will act in wrath My eye will not spare nor will I have pity And though they cry in my ears with a loud voice I will not hear them
