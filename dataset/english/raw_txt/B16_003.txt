2 Timothy 3
But understand this that in the last days there will come times of difficulty
For people will be lovers of self lovers of money proud arrogant abusive disobedient to their parents ungrateful unholy
heartless unappeasable slanderous without self control brutal not loving good
treacherous reckless swollen with conceit lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God
having the appearance of godliness but denying its power Avoid such people
For among them are those who creep into households and capture weak women burdened with sins and led astray by various passions
always learning and never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth
Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses so these men also oppose the truth men corrupted in mind and disqualified regarding the faith
But they will not get very far for their folly will be plain to all as was that of those two men
You however have followed my teaching my conduct my aim in life my faith my patience my love my steadfastness
my persecutions and sufferings that happened to me at Antioch at Iconium and at Lystra which persecutions I endured yet from them all the Lord rescued me
Indeed all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted
while evil people and impostors will go on from bad to worse deceiving and being deceived
But as for you continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed knowing from whom you learned it
and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus
All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching for reproof for correction and for training in righteousness
that the man of God may be competent equipped for every good work
