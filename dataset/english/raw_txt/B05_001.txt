Acts 1
In the first book O Theophilus I have dealt with all that Jesus began to do and teach
until the day when he was taken up after he had given commands through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen
He presented himself alive to them after his suffering by many proofs appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God
And while staying with them he ordered them not to depart from Jerusalem but to wait for the promise of the Father which he said you heard from me
for John baptized with water but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now
So when they had come together they asked him Lord will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel
He said to them It is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has fixed by his own authority
But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the end of the earth
And when he had said these things as they were looking on he was lifted up and a cloud took him out of their sight
And while they were gazing into heaven as he went behold two men stood by them in white robes
and said Men of Galilee why do you stand looking into heaven This Jesus who was taken up from you into heaven will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven
Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet which is near Jerusalem a Sabbath day s journey away
And when they had entered they went up to the upper room where they were staying Peter and John and James and Andrew Philip and Thomas Bartholomew and Matthew James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas the son of James
All these with one accord were devoting themselves to prayer together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus and his brothers
In those days Peter stood up among the brothers the company of persons was in all about and said
Brothers the Scripture had to be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand by the mouth of David concerning Judas who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus
For he was numbered among us and was allotted his share in this ministry
Now this man acquired a field with the reward of his wickedness and falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out
And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem so that the field was called in their own language Akeldama that is Field of Blood
For it is written in the Book of Psalms May his camp become desolate and let there be no one to dwell in it and Let another take his office
So one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us
beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from us one of these men must become with us a witness to his resurrection
And they put forward two Joseph called Barsabbas who was also called Justus and Matthias
And they prayed and said You Lord who know the hearts of all show which one of these two you have chosen
to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place
And they cast lots for them and the lot fell on Matthias and he was numbered with the eleven apostles
