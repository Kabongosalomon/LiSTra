Isaiah 30
Ah stubborn children declares the LORD who carry out a plan but not mine and who make an alliance but not of my Spirit that they may add sin to sin
who set out to go down to Egypt without asking for my direction to take refuge in the protection of Pharaoh and to seek shelter in the shadow of Egypt
Therefore shall the protection of Pharaoh turn to your shame and the shelter in the shadow of Egypt to your humiliation
For though his officials are at Zoan and his envoys reach Hanes
everyone comes to shame through a people that cannot profit them that brings neither help nor profit but shame and disgrace
An oracle on the beasts of the Negeb Through a land of trouble and anguish from where come the lioness and the lion the adder and the flying fiery serpent they carry their riches on the backs of donkeys and their treasures on the humps of camels to a people that cannot profit them
Egypt s help is worthless and empty therefore I have called her Rahab who sits still
And now go write it before them on a tablet and inscribe it in a book that it may be for the time to come as a witness forever
For they are a rebellious people lying children children unwilling to hear the instruction of the LORD
who say to the seers Do not see and to the prophets Do not prophesy to us what is right speak to us smooth things prophesy illusions
leave the way turn aside from the path let us hear no more about the Holy One of Israel
Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel Because you despise this word and trust in oppression and perverseness and rely on them
therefore this iniquity shall be to you like a breach in a high wall bulging out and about to collapse whose breaking comes suddenly in an instant
and its breaking is like that of a potter s vessel that is smashed so ruthlessly that among its fragments not a shard is found with which to take fire from the hearth or to dip up water out of the cistern
For thus said the Lord GOD the Holy One of Israel In returning and rest you shall be saved in quietness and in trust shall be your strength But you were unwilling
and you said No We will flee upon horses therefore you shall flee away and We will ride upon swift steeds therefore your pursuers shall be swift
A thousand shall flee at the threat of one at the threat of five you shall flee till you are left like a flagstaff on the top of a mountain like a signal on a hill
Therefore the LORD waits to be gracious to you and therefore he exalts himself to show mercy to you For the LORD is a God of justice blessed are all those who wait for him
For a people shall dwell in Zion in Jerusalem you shall weep no more He will surely be gracious to you at the sound of your cry As soon as he hears it he answers you
And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction yet your Teacher will not hide himself anymore but your eyes shall see your Teacher
And your ears shall hear a word behind you saying This is the way walk in it when you turn to the right or when you turn to the left
Then you will defile your carved idols overlaid with silver and your gold plated metal images You will scatter them as unclean things You will say to them Be gone
And he will give rain for the seed with which you sow the ground and bread the produce of the ground which will be rich and plenteous In that day your livestock will graze in large pastures
and the oxen and the donkeys that work the ground will eat seasoned fodder which has been winnowed with shovel and fork
And on every lofty mountain and every high hill there will be brooks running with water in the day of the great slaughter when the towers fall
Moreover the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun and the light of the sun will be sevenfold as the light of seven days in the day when the LORD binds up the brokenness of his people and heals the wounds inflicted by his blow
Behold the name of the LORD comes from afar burning with his anger and in thick rising smoke his lips are full of fury and his tongue is like a devouring fire
his breath is like an overflowing stream that reaches up to the neck to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction and to place on the jaws of the peoples a bridle that leads astray
You shall have a song as in the night when a holy feast is kept and gladness of heart as when one sets out to the sound of the flute to go to the mountain of the LORD to the Rock of Israel
And the LORD will cause his majestic voice to be heard and the descending blow of his arm to be seen in furious anger and a flame of devouring fire with a cloudburst and storm and hailstones
The Assyrians will be terror stricken at the voice of the LORD when he strikes with his rod
And every stroke of the appointed staff that the LORD lays on them will be to the sound of tambourines and lyres Battling with brandished arm he will fight with them
For a burning place has long been prepared indeed for the king it is made ready its pyre made deep and wide with fire and wood in abundance the breath of the LORD like a stream of sulfur kindles it
