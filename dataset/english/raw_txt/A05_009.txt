Deuteronomy 9
Hear O Israel you are to cross over the Jordan today to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves cities great and fortified up to heaven
a people great and tall the sons of the Anakim whom you know and of whom you have heard it said Who can stand before the sons of Anak
Know therefore today that he who goes over before you as a consuming fire is the LORD your God He will destroy them and subdue them before you So you shall drive them out and make them perish quickly as the LORD has promised you
Do not say in your heart after the LORD your God has thrust them out before you It is because of my righteousness that the LORD has brought me in to possess this land whereas it is because of the wickedness of these nations that the LORD is driving them out before you
Not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart are you going in to possess their land but because of the wickedness of these nations the LORD your God is driving them out from before you and that he may confirm the word that the LORD swore to your fathers to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob
Know therefore that the LORD your God is not giving you this good land to possess because of your righteousness for you are a stubborn people
Remember and do not forget how you provoked the LORD your God to wrath in the wilderness From the day you came out of the land of Egypt until you came to this place you have been rebellious against the LORD
Even at Horeb you provoked the LORD to wrath and the LORD was so angry with you that he was ready to destroy you
When I went up the mountain to receive the tablets of stone the tablets of the covenant that the LORD made with you I remained on the mountain forty days and forty nights I neither ate bread nor drank water
And the LORD gave me the two tablets of stone written with the finger of God and on them were all the words that the LORD had spoken with you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly
And at the end of forty days and forty nights the LORD gave me the two tablets of stone the tablets of the covenant
Then the LORD said to me Arise go down quickly from here for your people whom you have brought from Egypt have acted corruptly They have turned aside quickly out of the way that I commanded them they have made themselves a metal image
Furthermore the LORD said to me I have seen this people and behold it is a stubborn people
Let me alone that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven And I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they
So I turned and came down from the mountain and the mountain was burning with fire And the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands
And I looked and behold you had sinned against the LORD your God You had made yourselves a golden calf You had turned aside quickly from the way that the LORD had commanded you
So I took hold of the two tablets and threw them out of my two hands and broke them before your eyes
Then I lay prostrate before the LORD as before forty days and forty nights I neither ate bread nor drank water because of all the sin that you had committed in doing what was evil in the sight of the LORD to provoke him to anger
For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure that the LORD bore against you so that he was ready to destroy you But the LORD listened to me that time also
And the LORD was so angry with Aaron that he was ready to destroy him And I prayed for Aaron also at the same time
Then I took the sinful thing the calf that you had made and burned it with fire and crushed it grinding it very small until it was as fine as dust And I threw the dust of it into the brook that ran down from the mountain
At Taberah also and at Massah and at Kibroth hattaavah you provoked the LORD to wrath
And when the LORD sent you from Kadesh barnea saying Go up and take possession of the land that I have given you then you rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God and did not believe him or obey his voice
You have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you
So I lay prostrate before the LORD for these forty days and forty nights because the LORD had said he would destroy you
And I prayed to the LORD O Lord GOD do not destroy your people and your heritage whom you have redeemed through your greatness whom you have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand
Remember your servants Abraham Isaac and Jacob Do not regard the stubbornness of this people or their wickedness or their sin
lest the land from which you brought us say Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land that he promised them and because he hated them he has brought them out to put them to death in the wilderness
For they are your people and your heritage whom you brought out by your great power and by your outstretched arm
