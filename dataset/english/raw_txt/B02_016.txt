Mark 16
When the Sabbath was past Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Salome bought spices so that they might go and anoint him
And very early on the first day of the week when the sun had risen they went to the tomb
And they were saying to one another Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb
And looking up they saw that the stone had been rolled back it was very large
And entering the tomb they saw a young man sitting on the right side dressed in a white robe and they were alarmed
And he said to them Do not be alarmed You seek Jesus of Nazareth who was crucified He has risen he is not here See the place where they laid him
But go tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you to Galilee There you will see him just as he told you
And they went out and fled from the tomb for trembling and astonishment had seized them and they said nothing to anyone for they were afraid SOME OF THE EARLIEST MANUSCRIPTS DO NOT INCLUDE
Now when he rose early on the first day of the week he appeared first to Mary Magdalene from whom he had cast out seven demons
She went and told those who had been with him as they mourned and wept
But when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her they would not believe it
After these things he appeared in another form to two of them as they were walking into the country
And they went back and told the rest but they did not believe them
Afterward he appeared to the eleven themselves as they were reclining at table and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart because they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen
And he said to them Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation
Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved but whoever does not believe will be condemned
And these signs will accompany those who believe in my name they will cast out demons they will speak in new tongues
they will pick up serpents with their hands and if they drink any deadly poison it will not hurt them they will lay their hands on the sick and they will recover
So then the Lord Jesus after he had spoken to them was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God
And they went out and preached everywhere while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by accompanying signs
