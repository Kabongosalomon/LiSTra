Titus 1
Paul a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ for the sake of the faith of God s elect and their knowledge of the truth which accords with godliness
in hope of eternal life which God who never lies promised before the ages began
and at the proper time manifested in his word through the preaching with which I have been entrusted by the command of God our Savior
To Titus my true child in a common faith Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior
This is why I left you in Crete so that you might put what remained into order and appoint elders in every town as I directed you
if anyone is above reproach the husband of one wife and his children are believers and not open to the charge of debauchery or insubordination
For an overseer as God s steward must be above reproach He must not be arrogant or quick tempered or a drunkard or violent or greedy for gain
but hospitable a lover of good self controlled upright holy and disciplined
He must hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it
For there are many who are insubordinate empty talkers and deceivers especially those of the circumcision party
They must be silenced since they are upsetting whole families by teaching for shameful gain what they ought not to teach
One of the Cretans a prophet of their own said Cretans are always liars evil beasts lazy gluttons
This testimony is true Therefore rebuke them sharply that they may be sound in the faith
not devoting themselves to Jewish myths and the commands of people who turn away from the truth
To the pure all things are pure but to the defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure but both their minds and their consciences are defiled
They profess to know God but they deny him by their works They are detestable disobedient unfit for any good work
