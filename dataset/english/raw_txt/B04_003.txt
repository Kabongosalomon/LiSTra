John 3
Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews
This man came to Jesus by night and said to him Rabbi we know that you are a teacher come from God for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him
Jesus answered him Truly truly I say to you unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God
Nicodemus said to him How can a man be born when he is old Can he enter a second time into his mother s womb and be born
Jesus answered Truly truly I say to you unless one is born of water and the Spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of God
That which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit
Do not marvel that I said to you You must be born again
The wind blows where it wishes and you hear its sound but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit
Nicodemus said to him How can these things be
Jesus answered him Are you the teacher of Israel and yet you do not understand these things
Truly truly I say to you we speak of what we know and bear witness to what we have seen but you do not receive our testimony
If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things
No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven the Son of Man
And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness so must the Son of Man be lifted up
that whoever believes in him may have eternal life
For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life
For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world but in order that the world might be saved through him
Whoever believes in him is not condemned but whoever does not believe is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God
And this is the judgment the light has come into the world and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil
For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light lest his works should be exposed
But whoever does what is true comes to the light so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God
After this Jesus and his disciples went into the Judean countryside and he remained there with them and was baptizing
John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim because water was plentiful there and people were coming and being baptized
for John had not yet been put in prison
Now a discussion arose between some of John s disciples and a Jew over purification
And they came to John and said to him Rabbi he who was with you across the Jordan to whom you bore witness look he is baptizing and all are going to him
John answered A person cannot receive even one thing unless it is given him from heaven
You yourselves bear me witness that I said I am not the Christ but I have been sent before him
The one who has the bride is the bridegroom The friend of the bridegroom who stands and hears him rejoices greatly at the bridegroom s voice Therefore this joy of mine is now complete
He must increase but I must decrease
He who comes from above is above all He who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks in an earthly way He who comes from heaven is above all
He bears witness to what he has seen and heard yet no one receives his testimony
Whoever receives his testimony sets his seal to this that God is true
For he whom God has sent utters the words of God for he gives the Spirit without measure
The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand
Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life but the wrath of God remains on him
