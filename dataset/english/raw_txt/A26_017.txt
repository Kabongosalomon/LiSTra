Ezekiel 17
The word of the LORD came to me
Son of man propound a riddle and speak a parable to the house of Israel
say Thus says the Lord GOD A great eagle with great wings and long pinions rich in plumage of many colors came to Lebanon and took the top of the cedar
He broke off the topmost of its young twigs and carried it to a land of trade and set it in a city of merchants
Then he took of the seed of the land and planted it in fertile soil He placed it beside abundant waters He set it like a willow twig
and it sprouted and became a low spreading vine and its branches turned toward him and its roots remained where it stood So it became a vine and produced branches and put out boughs
And there was another great eagle with great wings and much plumage and behold this vine bent its roots toward him and shot forth its branches toward him from the bed where it was planted that he might water it
It had been planted on good soil by abundant waters that it might produce branches and bear fruit and become a noble vine
Say Thus says the Lord GOD Will it thrive Will he not pull up its roots and cut off its fruit so that it withers so that all its fresh sprouting leaves wither It will not take a strong arm or many people to pull it from its roots
Behold it is planted will it thrive Will it not utterly wither when the east wind strikes it wither away on the bed where it sprouted
Then the word of the LORD came to me
Say now to the rebellious house Do you not know what these things mean Tell them behold the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and took her king and her princes and brought them to him to Babylon
And he took one of the royal offspring and made a covenant with him putting him under oath the chief men of the land he had taken away
that the kingdom might be humble and not lift itself up and keep his covenant that it might stand
But he rebelled against him by sending his ambassadors to Egypt that they might give him horses and a large army Will he thrive Can one escape who does such things Can he break the covenant and yet escape
As I live declares the Lord GOD surely in the place where the king dwells who made him king whose oath he despised and whose covenant with him he broke in Babylon he shall die
Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company will not help him in war when mounds are cast up and siege walls built to cut off many lives
He despised the oath in breaking the covenant and behold he gave his hand and did all these things he shall not escape
Therefore thus says the Lord GOD As I live surely it is my oath that he despised and my covenant that he broke I will return it upon his head
I will spread my net over him and he shall be taken in my snare and I will bring him to Babylon and enter into judgment with him there for the treachery he has committed against me
And all the pick of his troops shall fall by the sword and the survivors shall be scattered to every wind and you shall know that I am the LORD I have spoken
Thus says the Lord GOD I myself will take a sprig from the lofty top of the cedar and will set it out I will break off from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one and I myself will plant it on a high and lofty mountain
On the mountain height of Israel will I plant it that it may bear branches and produce fruit and become a noble cedar And under it will dwell every kind of bird in the shade of its branches birds of every sort will nest
And all the trees of the field shall know that I am the LORD I bring low the high tree and make high the low tree dry up the green tree and make the dry tree flourish I am the LORD I have spoken and I will do it
