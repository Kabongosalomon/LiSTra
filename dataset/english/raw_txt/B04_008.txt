John 8
but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives
Early in the morning he came again to the temple All the people came to him and he sat down and taught them
The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery and placing her in the midst
they said to him Teacher this woman has been caught in the act of adultery
Now in the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women So what do you say
This they said to test him that they might have some charge to bring against him Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground
And as they continued to ask him he stood up and said to them Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her
And once more he bent down and wrote on the ground
But when they heard it they went away one by one beginning with the older ones and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him
Jesus stood up and said to her Woman where are they Has no one condemned you
She said No one Lord And Jesus said Neither do I condemn you go and from now on sin no more
Again Jesus spoke to them saying I am the light of the world Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness but will have the light of life
So the Pharisees said to him You are bearing witness about yourself your testimony is not true
Jesus answered Even if I do bear witness about myself my testimony is true for I know where I came from and where I am going but you do not know where I come from or where I am going
You judge according to the flesh I judge no one
Yet even if I do judge my judgment is true for it is not I alone who judge but I and the Father who sent me
In your Law it is written that the testimony of two people is true
I am the one who bears witness about myself and the Father who sent me bears witness about me
They said to him therefore Where is your Father Jesus answered You know neither me nor my Father If you knew me you would know my Father also
These words he spoke in the treasury as he taught in the temple but no one arrested him because his hour had not yet come
So he said to them again I am going away and you will seek me and you will die in your sin Where I am going you cannot come
So the Jews said Will he kill himself since he says Where I am going you cannot come
He said to them You are from below I am from above You are of this world I am not of this world
I told you that you would die in your sins for unless you believe that I am he you will die in your sins
So they said to him Who are you Jesus said to them Just what I have been telling you from the beginning
I have much to say about you and much to judge but he who sent me is true and I declare to the world what I have heard from him
They did not understand that he had been speaking to them about the Father
So Jesus said to them When you have lifted up the Son of Man then you will know that I am he and that I do nothing on my own authority but speak just as the Father taught me
And he who sent me is with me He has not left me alone for I always do the things that are pleasing to him
As he was saying these things many believed in him
So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in him If you abide in my word you are truly my disciples
and you will know the truth and the truth will set you free
They answered him We are offspring of Abraham and have never been enslaved to anyone How is it that you say You will become free
Jesus answered them Truly truly I say to you everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin
The slave does not remain in the house forever the son remains forever
So if the Son sets you free you will be free indeed
I know that you are offspring of Abraham yet you seek to kill me because my word finds no place in you
I speak of what I have seen with my Father and you do what you have heard from your father
They answered him Abraham is our father Jesus said to them If you were Abraham s children you would be doing the works Abraham did
but now you seek to kill me a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God This is not what Abraham did
You are doing the works your father did They said to him We were not born of sexual immorality We have one Father even God
Jesus said to them If God were your Father you would love me for I came from God and I am here I came not of my own accord but he sent me
Why do you not understand what I say It is because you cannot bear to hear my word
You are of your father the devil and your will is to do your father s desires He was a murderer from the beginning and has nothing to do with the truth because there is no truth in him When he lies he speaks out of his own character for he is a liar and the father of lies
But because I tell the truth you do not believe me
Which one of you convicts me of sin If I tell the truth why do you not believe me
Whoever is of God hears the words of God The reason why you do not hear them is that you are not of God
The Jews answered him Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon
Jesus answered I do not have a demon but I honor my Father and you dishonor me
Yet I do not seek my own glory there is One who seeks it and he is the judge
Truly truly I say to you if anyone keeps my word he will never see death
The Jews said to him Now we know that you have a demon Abraham died as did the prophets yet you say If anyone keeps my word he will never taste death
Are you greater than our father Abraham who died And the prophets died Who do you make yourself out to be
Jesus answered If I glorify myself my glory is nothing It is my Father who glorifies me of whom you say He is our God
But you have not known him I know him If I were to say that I do not know him I would be a liar like you but I do know him and I keep his word
Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day He saw it and was glad
So the Jews said to him You are not yet fifty years old and have you seen Abraham
Jesus said to them Truly truly I say to you before Abraham was I am
So they picked up stones to throw at him but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple
