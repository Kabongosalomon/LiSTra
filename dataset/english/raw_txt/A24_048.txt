Jeremiah 48
Concerning Moab Thus says the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Woe to Nebo for it is laid waste Kiriathaim is put to shame it is taken the fortress is put to shame and broken down
the renown of Moab is no more In Heshbon they planned disaster against her Come let us cut her off from being a nation You also O Madmen shall be brought to silence the sword shall pursue you
A voice A cry from Horonaim Desolation and great destruction
Moab is destroyed her little ones have made a cry
For at the ascent of Luhith they go up weeping for at the descent of Horonaim they have heard the distressed cry of destruction
Flee Save yourselves You will be like a juniper in the desert
For because you trusted in your works and your treasures you also shall be taken and Chemosh shall go into exile with his priests and his officials
The destroyer shall come upon every city and no city shall escape the valley shall perish and the plain shall be destroyed as the LORD has spoken
Give wings to Moab for she would fly away her cities shall become a desolation with no inhabitant in them
Cursed is he who does the work of the LORD with slackness and cursed is he who keeps back his sword from bloodshed
Moab has been at ease from his youth and has settled on his dregs he has not been emptied from vessel to vessel nor has he gone into exile so his taste remains in him and his scent is not changed
Therefore behold the days are coming declares the LORD when I shall send to him pourers who will pour him and empty his vessels and break his jars in pieces
Then Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence
How do you say We are heroes and mighty men of war
The destroyer of Moab and his cities has come up and the choicest of his young men have gone down to slaughter declares the King whose name is the LORD of hosts
The calamity of Moab is near at hand and his affliction hastens swiftly
Grieve for him all you who are around him and all who know his name say How the mighty scepter is broken the glorious staff
Come down from your glory and sit on the parched ground O inhabitant of Dibon For the destroyer of Moab has come up against you he has destroyed your strongholds
Stand by the way and watch O inhabitant of Aroer Ask him who flees and her who escapes say What has happened
Moab is put to shame for it is broken wail and cry Tell it beside the Arnon that Moab is laid waste
Judgment has come upon the tableland upon Holon and Jahzah and Mephaath
and Dibon and Nebo and Beth diblathaim
and Kiriathaim and Beth gamul and Beth meon
and Kerioth and Bozrah and all the cities of the land of Moab far and near
The horn of Moab is cut off and his arm is broken declares the LORD
Make him drunk because he magnified himself against the LORD so that Moab shall wallow in his vomit and he too shall be held in derision
Was not Israel a derision to you Was he found among thieves that whenever you spoke of him you wagged your head
Leave the cities and dwell in the rock O inhabitants of Moab Be like the dove that nests in the sides of the mouth of a gorge
We have heard of the pride of Moab he is very proud of his loftiness his pride and his arrogance and the haughtiness of his heart
I know his insolence declares the LORD his boasts are false his deeds are false
Therefore I wail for Moab I cry out for all Moab for the men of Kir hareseth I mourn
More than for Jazer I weep for you O vine of Sibmah Your branches passed over the sea reached to the Sea of Jazer on your summer fruits and your grapes the destroyer has fallen
Gladness and joy have been taken away from the fruitful land of Moab I have made the wine cease from the winepresses no one treads them with shouts of joy the shouting is not the shout of joy
From the outcry at Heshbon even to Elealeh as far as Jahaz they utter their voice from Zoar to Horonaim and Eglath shelishiyah For the waters of Nimrim also have become desolate
And I will bring to an end in Moab declares the LORD him who offers sacrifice in the high place and makes offerings to his god
Therefore my heart moans for Moab like a flute and my heart moans like a flute for the men of Kir hareseth Therefore the riches they gained have perished
For every head is shaved and every beard cut off On all the hands are gashes and around the waist is sackcloth
On all the housetops of Moab and in the squares there is nothing but lamentation for I have broken Moab like a vessel for which no one cares declares the LORD
How it is broken How they wail How Moab has turned his back in shame So Moab has become a derision and a horror to all that are around him
For thus says the LORD Behold one shall fly swiftly like an eagle and spread his wings against Moab
the cities shall be taken and the strongholds seized The heart of the warriors of Moab shall be in that day like the heart of a woman in her birth pains
Moab shall be destroyed and be no longer a people because he magnified himself against the LORD
Terror pit and snare are before you O inhabitant of Moab declares the LORD
He who flees from the terror shall fall into the pit and he who climbs out of the pit shall be caught in the snare For I will bring these things upon Moab the year of their punishment declares the LORD
In the shadow of Heshbon fugitives stop without strength for fire came out from Heshbon flame from the house of Sihon it has destroyed the forehead of Moab the crown of the sons of tumult
Woe to you O Moab The people of Chemosh are undone for your sons have been taken captive and your daughters into captivity
Yet I will restore the fortunes of Moab in the latter days declares the LORD Thus far is the judgment on Moab
