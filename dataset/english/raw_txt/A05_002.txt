Deuteronomy 2
Then we turned and journeyed into the wilderness in the direction of the Red Sea as the LORD told me And for many days we traveled around Mount Seir
Then the LORD said to me
You have been traveling around this mountain country long enough Turn northward
and command the people You are about to pass through the territory of your brothers the people of Esau who live in Seir and they will be afraid of you So be very careful
Do not contend with them for I will not give you any of their land no not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession
You shall purchase food from them for money that you may eat and you shall also buy water of them for money that you may drink
For the LORD your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands He knows your going through this great wilderness These forty years the LORD your God has been with you You have lacked nothing
So we went on away from our brothers the people of Esau who live in Seir away from the Arabah road from Elath and Ezion geber And we turned and went in the direction of the wilderness of Moab
And the LORD said to me Do not harass Moab or contend with them in battle for I will not give you any of their land for a possession because I have given Ar to the people of Lot for a possession
The Emim formerly lived there a people great and many and tall as the Anakim
Like the Anakim they are also counted as Rephaim but the Moabites call them Emim
The Horites also lived in Seir formerly but the people of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from before them and settled in their place as Israel did to the land of their possession which the LORD gave to them
Now rise up and go over the brook Zered So we went over the brook Zered
And the time from our leaving Kadesh barnea until we crossed the brook Zered was thirty eight years until the entire generation that is the men of war had perished from the camp as the LORD had sworn to them
For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them to destroy them from the camp until they had perished
So as soon as all the men of war had perished and were dead from among the people
the LORD said to me
Today you are to cross the border of Moab at Ar
And when you approach the territory of the people of Ammon do not harass them or contend with them for I will not give you any of the land of the people of Ammon as a possession because I have given it to the sons of Lot for a possession
It is also counted as a land of Rephaim Rephaim formerly lived there but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim
a people great and many and tall as the Anakim but the LORD destroyed them before the Ammonites and they dispossessed them and settled in their place
as he did for the people of Esau who live in Seir when he destroyed the Horites before them and they dispossessed them and settled in their place even to this day
As for the Avvim who lived in villages as far as Gaza the Caphtorim who came from Caphtor destroyed them and settled in their place
Rise up set out on your journey and go over the Valley of the Arnon Behold I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite king of Heshbon and his land Begin to take possession and contend with him in battle
This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole heaven who shall hear the report of you and shall tremble and be in anguish because of you
So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon the king of Heshbon with words of peace saying
Let me pass through your land I will go only by the road I will turn aside neither to the right nor to the left
You shall sell me food for money that I may eat and give me water for money that I may drink Only let me pass through on foot
as the sons of Esau who live in Seir and the Moabites who live in Ar did for me until I go over the Jordan into the land that the LORD our God is giving to us
But Sihon the king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him for the LORD your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate that he might give him into your hand as he is this day
And the LORD said to me Behold I have begun to give Sihon and his land over to you Begin to take possession that you may occupy his land
Then Sihon came out against us he and all his people to battle at Jahaz
And the LORD our God gave him over to us and we defeated him and his sons and all his people
And we captured all his cities at that time and devoted to destruction every city men women and children We left no survivors
Only the livestock we took as spoil for ourselves with the plunder of the cities that we captured
From Aroer which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon and from the city that is in the valley as far as Gilead there was not a city too high for us The LORD our God gave all into our hands
Only to the land of the sons of Ammon you did not draw near that is to all the banks of the river Jabbok and the cities of the hill country whatever the LORD our God had forbidden us
