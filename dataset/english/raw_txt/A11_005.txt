1 Kings 5
Now Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon when he heard that they had anointed him king in place of his father for Hiram always loved David
And Solomon sent word to Hiram
You know that David my father could not build a house for the name of the LORD his God because of the warfare with which his enemies surrounded him until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet
But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side There is neither adversary nor misfortune
And so I intend to build a house for the name of the LORD my God as the LORD said to David my father Your son whom I will set on your throne in your place shall build the house for my name
Now therefore command that cedars of Lebanon be cut for me And my servants will join your servants and I will pay you for your servants such wages as you set for you know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians
As soon as Hiram heard the words of Solomon he rejoiced greatly and said Blessed be the LORD this day who has given to David a wise son to be over this great people
And Hiram sent to Solomon saying I have heard the message that you have sent to me I am ready to do all you desire in the matter of cedar and cypress timber
My servants shall bring it down to the sea from Lebanon and I will make it into rafts to go by sea to the place you direct And I will have them broken up there and you shall receive it And you shall meet my wishes by providing food for my household
So Hiram supplied Solomon with all the timber of cedar and cypress that he desired
while Solomon gave Hiram cors of wheat as food for his household and cors of beaten oil Solomon gave this to Hiram year by year
And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom as he promised him And there was peace between Hiram and Solomon and the two of them made a treaty
King Solomon drafted forced labor out of all Israel and the draft numbered men
And he sent them to Lebanon a month in shifts They would be a month in Lebanon and two months at home Adoniram was in charge of the draft
Solomon also had burden bearers and stonecutters in the hill country
besides Solomon s chief officers who were over the work who had charge of the people who carried on the work
At the king s command they quarried out great costly stones in order to lay the foundation of the house with dressed stones
So Solomon s builders and Hiram s builders and the men of Gebal did the cutting and prepared the timber and the stone to build the house
