Proverbs 15
A soft answer turns away wrath but a harsh word stirs up anger
The tongue of the wise commends knowledge but the mouths of fools pour out folly
The eyes of the LORD are in every place keeping watch on the evil and the good
A gentle tongue is a tree of life but perverseness in it breaks the spirit
A fool despises his father s instruction but whoever heeds reproof is prudent
In the house of the righteous there is much treasure but trouble befalls the income of the wicked
The lips of the wise spread knowledge not so the hearts of fools
The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD but the prayer of the upright is acceptable to him
The way of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD but he loves him who pursues righteousness
There is severe discipline for him who forsakes the way whoever hates reproof will die
Sheol and Abaddon lie open before the LORD how much more the hearts of the children of man
A scoffer does not like to be reproved he will not go to the wise
A glad heart makes a cheerful face but by sorrow of heart the spirit is crushed
The heart of him who has understanding seeks knowledge but the mouths of fools feed on folly
All the days of the afflicted are evil but the cheerful of heart has a continual feast
Better is a little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure and trouble with it
Better is a dinner of herbs where love is than a fattened ox and hatred with it
A hot tempered man stirs up strife but he who is slow to anger quiets contention
The way of a sluggard is like a hedge of thorns but the path of the upright is a level highway
A wise son makes a glad father but a foolish man despises his mother
Folly is a joy to him who lacks sense but a man of understanding walks straight ahead
Without counsel plans fail but with many advisers they succeed
To make an apt answer is a joy to a man and a word in season how good it is
The path of life leads upward for the prudent that he may turn away from Sheol beneath
The LORD tears down the house of the proud but maintains the widow s boundaries
The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the LORD but gracious words are pure
Whoever is greedy for unjust gain troubles his own household but he who hates bribes will live
The heart of the righteous ponders how to answer but the mouth of the wicked pours out evil things
The LORD is far from the wicked but he hears the prayer of the righteous
The light of the eyes rejoices the heart and good news refreshes the bones
The ear that listens to life giving reproof will dwell among the wise
Whoever ignores instruction despises himself but he who listens to reproof gains intelligence
The fear of the LORD is instruction in wisdom and humility comes before honor
