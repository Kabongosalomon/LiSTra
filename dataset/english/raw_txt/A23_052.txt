Isaiah 52
Awake awake put on your strength O Zion put on your beautiful garments O Jerusalem the holy city for there shall no more come into you the uncircumcised and the unclean
Shake yourself from the dust and arise be seated O Jerusalem loose the bonds from your neck O captive daughter of Zion
For thus says the LORD You were sold for nothing and you shall be redeemed without money
For thus says the Lord GOD My people went down at the first into Egypt to sojourn there and the Assyrian oppressed them for nothing
Now therefore what have I here declares the LORD seeing that my people are taken away for nothing Their rulers wail declares the LORD and continually all the day my name is despised
Therefore my people shall know my name Therefore in that day they shall know that it is I who speak here am I
How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news who publishes peace who brings good news of happiness who publishes salvation who says to Zion Your God reigns
The voice of your watchmen they lift up their voice together they sing for joy for eye to eye they see the return of the LORD to Zion
Break forth together into singing you waste places of Jerusalem for the LORD has comforted his people he has redeemed Jerusalem
The LORD has bared his holy arm before the eyes of all the nations and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God
Depart depart go out from there touch no unclean thing go out from the midst of her purify yourselves you who bear the vessels of the LORD
For you shall not go out in haste and you shall not go in flight for the LORD will go before you and the God of Israel will be your rear guard
Behold my servant shall act wisely he shall be high and lifted up and shall be exalted
As many were astonished at you his appearance was so marred beyond human semblance and his form beyond that of the children of mankind
so shall he sprinkle many nations kings shall shut their mouths because of him for that which has not been told them they see and that which they have not heard they understand
