Exodus 1
These are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob each with his household
Reuben Simeon Levi and Judah
Issachar Zebulun and Benjamin
Dan and Naphtali Gad and Asher
All the descendants of Jacob were seventy persons Joseph was already in Egypt
Then Joseph died and all his brothers and all that generation
But the people of Israel were fruitful and increased greatly they multiplied and grew exceedingly strong so that the land was filled with them
Now there arose a new king over Egypt who did not know Joseph
And he said to his people Behold the people of Israel are too many and too mighty for us
Come let us deal shrewdly with them lest they multiply and if war breaks out they join our enemies and fight against us and escape from the land
Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with heavy burdens They built for Pharaoh store cities Pithom and Raamses
But the more they were oppressed the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad And the Egyptians were in dread of the people of Israel
So they ruthlessly made the people of Israel work as slaves
and made their lives bitter with hard service in mortar and brick and in all kinds of work in the field In all their work they ruthlessly made them work as slaves
Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives one of whom was named Shiphrah and the other Puah
When you serve as midwife to the Hebrew women and see them on the birthstool if it is a son you shall kill him but if it is a daughter she shall live
But the midwives feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them but let the male children live
So the king of Egypt called the midwives and said to them Why have you done this and let the male children live
The midwives said to Pharaoh Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife comes to them
So God dealt well with the midwives And the people multiplied and grew very strong
And because the midwives feared God he gave them families
Then Pharaoh commanded all his people Every son that is born to the Hebrews you shall cast into the Nile but you shall let every daughter live
