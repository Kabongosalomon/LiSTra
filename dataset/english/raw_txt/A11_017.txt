1 Kings 17
Now Elijah the Tishbite of Tishbe in Gilead said to Ahab As the LORD the God of Israel lives before whom I stand there shall be neither dew nor rain these years except by my word
And the word of the LORD came to him
Depart from here and turn eastward and hide yourself by the brook Cherith which is east of the Jordan
You shall drink from the brook and I have commanded the ravens to feed you there
So he went and did according to the word of the LORD He went and lived by the brook Cherith that is east of the Jordan
And the ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening and he drank from the brook
And after a while the brook dried up because there was no rain in the land
Then the word of the LORD came to him
Arise go to Zarephath which belongs to Sidon and dwell there Behold I have commanded a widow there to feed you
So he arose and went to Zarephath And when he came to the gate of the city behold a widow was there gathering sticks And he called to her and said Bring me a little water in a vessel that I may drink
And as she was going to bring it he called to her and said Bring me a morsel of bread in your hand
And she said As the LORD your God lives I have nothing baked only a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug And now I am gathering a couple of sticks that I may go in and prepare it for myself and my son that we may eat it and die
And Elijah said to her Do not fear go and do as you have said But first make me a little cake of it and bring it to me and afterward make something for yourself and your son
For thus says the LORD the God of Israel The jar of flour shall not be spent and the jug of oil shall not be empty until the day that the LORD sends rain upon the earth
And she went and did as Elijah said And she and he and her household ate for many days
The jar of flour was not spent neither did the jug of oil become empty according to the word of the LORD that he spoke by Elijah
After this the son of the woman the mistress of the house became ill And his illness was so severe that there was no breath left in him
And she said to Elijah What have you against me O man of God You have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance and to cause the death of my son
And he said to her Give me your son And he took him from her arms and carried him up into the upper chamber where he lodged and laid him on his own bed
And he cried to the LORD O LORD my God have you brought calamity even upon the widow with whom I sojourn by killing her son
Then he stretched himself upon the child three times and cried to the LORD O LORD my God let this child s life come into him again
And the LORD listened to the voice of Elijah And the life of the child came into him again and he revived
And Elijah took the child and brought him down from the upper chamber into the house and delivered him to his mother And Elijah said See your son lives
And the woman said to Elijah Now I know that you are a man of God and that the word of the LORD in your mouth is truth
