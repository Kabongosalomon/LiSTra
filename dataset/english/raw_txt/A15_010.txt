Ezra 10
While Ezra prayed and made confession weeping and casting himself down before the house of God a very great assembly of men women and children gathered to him out of Israel for the people wept bitterly
And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel of the sons of Elam addressed Ezra We have broken faith with our God and have married foreign women from the peoples of the land but even now there is hope for Israel in spite of this
Therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all these wives and their children according to the counsel of my lord and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God and let it be done according to the Law
Arise for it is your task and we are with you be strong and do it
Then Ezra arose and made the leading priests and Levites and all Israel take oath that they would do as had been said So they took the oath
Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God and went to the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib where he spent the night neither eating bread nor drinking water for he was mourning over the faithlessness of the exiles
And a proclamation was made throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the returned exiles that they should assemble at Jerusalem
and that if anyone did not come within three days by order of the officials and the elders all his property should be forfeited and he himself banned from the congregation of the exiles
Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled at Jerusalem within the three days It was the ninth month on the twentieth day of the month And all the people sat in the open square before the house of God trembling because of this matter and because of the heavy rain
And Ezra the priest stood up and said to them You have broken faith and married foreign women and so increased the guilt of Israel
Now then make confession to the LORD the God of your fathers and do his will Separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign wives
Then all the assembly answered with a loud voice It is so we must do as you have said
But the people are many and it is a time of heavy rain we cannot stand in the open Nor is this a task for one day or for two for we have greatly transgressed in this matter
Let our officials stand for the whole assembly Let all in our cities who have taken foreign wives come at appointed times and with them the elders and judges of every city until the fierce wrath of our God over this matter is turned away from us
Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah opposed this and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supported them
Then the returned exiles did so Ezra the priest selected men heads of fathers houses according to their fathers houses each of them designated by name On the first day of the tenth month they sat down to examine the matter
and by the first day of the first month they had come to the end of all the men who had married foreign women
Now there were found some of the sons of the priests who had married foreign women Maaseiah Eliezer Jarib and Gedaliah some of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak and his brothers
They pledged themselves to put away their wives and their guilt offering was a ram of the flock for their guilt
