Micah 2
Woe to those who devise wickedness and work evil on their beds When the morning dawns they perform it because it is in the power of their hand
They covet fields and seize them and houses and take them away they oppress a man and his house a man and his inheritance
Therefore thus says the LORD behold against this family I am devising disaster from which you cannot remove your necks and you shall not walk haughtily for it will be a time of disaster
In that day they shall take up a taunt song against you and moan bitterly and say We are utterly ruined he changes the portion of my people how he removes it from me To an apostate he allots our fields
Therefore you will have none to cast the line by lot in the assembly of the LORD
Do not preach thus they preach one should not preach of such things disgrace will not overtake us
Should this be said O house of Jacob Has the LORD grown impatient Are these his deeds Do not my words do good to him who walks uprightly
But lately my people have risen up as an enemy you strip the rich robe from those who pass by trustingly with no thought of war
The women of my people you drive out from their delightful houses from their young children you take away my splendor forever
Arise and go for this is no place to rest because of uncleanness that destroys with a grievous destruction
If a man should go about and utter wind and lies saying I will preach to you of wine and strong drink he would be the preacher for this people
I will surely assemble all of you O Jacob I will gather the remnant of Israel I will set them together like sheep in a fold like a flock in its pasture a noisy multitude of men
He who opens the breach goes up before them they break through and pass the gate going out by it Their king passes on before them the LORD at their head
