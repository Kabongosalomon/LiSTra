Jonah 2
Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the belly of the fish
saying I called out to the LORD out of my distress and he answered me out of the belly of Sheol I cried and you heard my voice
For you cast me into the deep into the heart of the seas and the flood surrounded me all your waves and your billows passed over me
Then I said I am driven away from your sight yet I shall again look upon your holy temple
The waters closed in over me to take my life the deep surrounded me weeds were wrapped about my head
at the roots of the mountains I went down to the land whose bars closed upon me forever yet you brought up my life from the pit O LORD my God
When my life was fainting away I remembered the LORD and my prayer came to you into your holy temple
Those who pay regard to vain idols forsake their hope of steadfast love
But I with the voice of thanksgiving will sacrifice to you what I have vowed I will pay Salvation belongs to the LORD
And the LORD spoke to the fish and it vomited Jonah out upon the dry land
