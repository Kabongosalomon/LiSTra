Job 4
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said
If one ventures a word with you will you be impatient Yet who can keep from speaking
Behold you have instructed many and you have strengthened the weak hands
Your words have upheld him who was stumbling and you have made firm the feeble knees
But now it has come to you and you are impatient it touches you and you are dismayed
Is not your fear of God your confidence and the integrity of your ways your hope
Remember who that was innocent ever perished Or where were the upright cut off
As I have seen those who plow iniquity and sow trouble reap the same
By the breath of God they perish and by the blast of his anger they are consumed
The roar of the lion the voice of the fierce lion the teeth of the young lions are broken
The strong lion perishes for lack of prey and the cubs of the lioness are scattered
Now a word was brought to me stealthily my ear received the whisper of it
Amid thoughts from visions of the night when deep sleep falls on men
dread came upon me and trembling which made all my bones shake
A spirit glided past my face the hair of my flesh stood up
It stood still but I could not discern its appearance A form was before my eyes there was silence then I heard a voice
Can mortal man be in the right before God Can a man be pure before his Maker
Even in his servants he puts no trust and his angels he charges with error
how much more those who dwell in houses of clay whose foundation is in the dust who are crushed like the moth
Between morning and evening they are beaten to pieces they perish forever without anyone regarding it
Is not their tent cord plucked up within them do they not die and that without wisdom
