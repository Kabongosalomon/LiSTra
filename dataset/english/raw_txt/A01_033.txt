Genesis 33
And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked and behold Esau was coming and four hundred men with him So he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two female servants
And he put the servants with their children in front then Leah with her children and Rachel and Joseph last of all
He himself went on before them bowing himself to the ground seven times until he came near to his brother
But Esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him and they wept
And when Esau lifted up his eyes and saw the women and children he said Who are these with you Jacob said The children whom God has graciously given your servant
Then the servants drew near they and their children and bowed down
Leah likewise and her children drew near and bowed down And last Joseph and Rachel drew near and they bowed down
Esau said What do you mean by all this company that I met Jacob answered To find favor in the sight of my lord
But Esau said I have enough my brother keep what you have for yourself
Jacob said No please if I have found favor in your sight then accept my present from my hand For I have seen your face which is like seeing the face of God and you have accepted me
Please accept my blessing that is brought to you because God has dealt graciously with me and because I have enough Thus he urged him and he took it
Then Esau said Let us journey on our way and I will go ahead of you
But Jacob said to him My lord knows that the children are frail and that the nursing flocks and herds are a care to me If they are driven hard for one day all the flocks will die
Let my lord pass on ahead of his servant and I will lead on slowly at the pace of the livestock that are ahead of me and at the pace of the children until I come to my lord in Seir
So Esau said Let me leave with you some of the people who are with me But he said What need is there Let me find favor in the sight of my lord
So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir
But Jacob journeyed to Succoth and built himself a house and made booths for his livestock Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth
And Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem which is in the land of Canaan on his way from Paddan aram and he camped before the city
And from the sons of Hamor Shechem s father he bought for a hundred pieces of money the piece of land on which he had pitched his tent
There he erected an altar and called it El Elohe Israel
