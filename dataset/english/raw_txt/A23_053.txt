Isaiah 53
Who has believed what he has heard from us And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed
For he grew up before him like a young plant and like a root out of dry ground he had no form or majesty that we should look at him and no beauty that we should desire him
He was despised and rejected by men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised and we esteemed him not
Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we esteemed him stricken smitten by God and afflicted
But he was wounded for our transgressions he was crushed for our iniquities upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace and with his stripes we are healed
All we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all
He was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth like a lamb that is led to the slaughter and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent so he opened not his mouth
By oppression and judgment he was taken away and as for his generation who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living stricken for the transgression of my people
And they made his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death although he had done no violence and there was no deceit in his mouth
Yet it was the will of the LORD to crush him he has put him to grief when his soul makes an offering for guilt he shall see his offspring he shall prolong his days the will of the LORD shall prosper in his hand
Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied by his knowledge shall the righteous one my servant make many to be accounted righteous and he shall bear their iniquities
Therefore I will divide him a portion with the many and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he poured out his soul to death and was numbered with the transgressors yet he bore the sin of many and makes intercession for the transgressors
