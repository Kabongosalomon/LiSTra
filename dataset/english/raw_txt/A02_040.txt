Exodus 40
The LORD spoke to Moses saying
On the first day of the first month you shall erect the tabernacle of the tent of meeting
And you shall put in it the ark of the testimony and you shall screen the ark with the veil
And you shall bring in the table and arrange it and you shall bring in the lampstand and set up its lamps
And you shall put the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony and set up the screen for the door of the tabernacle
You shall set the altar of burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting
and place the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it
And you shall set up the court all around and hang up the screen for the gate of the court
Then you shall take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and all that is in it and consecrate it and all its furniture so that it may become holy
You shall also anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils and consecrate the altar so that the altar may become most holy
You shall also anoint the basin and its stand and consecrate it
Then you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the tent of meeting and shall wash them with water
and put on Aaron the holy garments And you shall anoint him and consecrate him that he may serve me as priest
You shall bring his sons also and put coats on them
and anoint them as you anointed their father that they may serve me as priests And their anointing shall admit them to a perpetual priesthood throughout their generations
This Moses did according to all that the LORD commanded him so he did
In the first month in the second year on the first day of the month the tabernacle was erected
Moses erected the tabernacle He laid its bases and set up its frames and put in its poles and raised up its pillars
And he spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering of the tent over it as the LORD had commanded Moses
He took the testimony and put it into the ark and put the poles on the ark and set the mercy seat above on the ark
And he brought the ark into the tabernacle and set up the veil of the screen and screened the ark of the testimony as the LORD had commanded Moses
He put the table in the tent of meeting on the north side of the tabernacle outside the veil
and arranged the bread on it before the LORD as the LORD had commanded Moses
He put the lampstand in the tent of meeting opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle
and set up the lamps before the LORD as the LORD had commanded Moses
He put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the veil
and burned fragrant incense on it as the LORD had commanded Moses
He put in place the screen for the door of the tabernacle
And he set the altar of burnt offering at the entrance of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting and offered on it the burnt offering and the grain offering as the LORD had commanded Moses
He set the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing
with which Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet
When they went into the tent of meeting and when they approached the altar they washed as the LORD commanded Moses
And he erected the court around the tabernacle and the altar and set up the screen of the gate of the court So Moses finished the work
Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle
And Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud settled on it and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle
Throughout all their journeys whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle the people of Israel would set out
But if the cloud was not taken up then they did not set out till the day that it was taken up
For the cloud of the LORD was on the tabernacle by day and fire was in it by night in the sight of all the house of Israel throughout all their journeys
