Genesis 47
So Joseph went in and told Pharaoh My father and my brothers with their flocks and herds and all that they possess have come from the land of Canaan They are now in the land of Goshen
And from among his brothers he took five men and presented them to Pharaoh
Pharaoh said to his brothers What is your occupation And they said to Pharaoh Your servants are shepherds as our fathers were
They said to Pharaoh We have come to sojourn in the land for there is no pasture for your servants flocks for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan And now please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen
Then Pharaoh said to Joseph Your father and your brothers have come to you
The land of Egypt is before you Settle your father and your brothers in the best of the land Let them settle in the land of Goshen and if you know any able men among them put them in charge of my livestock
Then Joseph brought in Jacob his father and stood him before Pharaoh and Jacob blessed Pharaoh
And Pharaoh said to Jacob How many are the days of the years of your life
And Jacob said to Pharaoh The days of the years of my sojourning are years Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their sojourning
And Jacob blessed Pharaoh and went out from the presence of Pharaoh
Then Joseph settled his father and his brothers and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt in the best of the land in the land of Rameses as Pharaoh had commanded
And Joseph provided his father his brothers and all his father s household with food according to the number of their dependents
Now there was no food in all the land for the famine was very severe so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished by reason of the famine
And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan in exchange for the grain that they bought And Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh s house
And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said Give us food Why should we die before your eyes For our money is gone
And Joseph answered Give your livestock and I will give you food in exchange for your livestock if your money is gone
So they brought their livestock to Joseph and Joseph gave them food in exchange for the horses the flocks the herds and the donkeys He supplied them with food in exchange for all their livestock that year
And when that year was ended they came to him the following year and said to him We will not hide from my lord that our money is all spent The herds of livestock are my lord s There is nothing left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our land
Why should we die before your eyes both we and our land Buy us and our land for food and we with our land will be servants to Pharaoh And give us seed that we may live and not die and that the land may not be desolate
So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh for all the Egyptians sold their fields because the famine was severe on them The land became Pharaoh s
As for the people he made servants of them from one end of Egypt to the other
Only the land of the priests he did not buy for the priests had a fixed allowance from Pharaoh and lived on the allowance that Pharaoh gave them therefore they did not sell their land
Then Joseph said to the people Behold I have this day bought you and your land for Pharaoh Now here is seed for you and you shall sow the land
And at the harvests you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh and four fifths shall be your own as seed for the field and as food for yourselves and your households and as food for your little ones
And they said You have saved our lives may it please my lord we will be servants to Pharaoh
So Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt and it stands to this day that Pharaoh should have the fifth the land of the priests alone did not become Pharaoh s
Thus Israel settled in the land of Egypt in the land of Goshen And they gained possessions in it and were fruitful and multiplied greatly
And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years So the days of Jacob the years of his life were years
And when the time drew near that Israel must die he called his son Joseph and said to him If now I have found favor in your sight put your hand under my thigh and promise to deal kindly and truly with me Do not bury me in Egypt
but let me lie with my fathers Carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burying place He answered I will do as you have said
And he said Swear to me and he swore to him Then Israel bowed himself upon the head of his bed
