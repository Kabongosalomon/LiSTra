These are the stages of the people of Israel when they went out of the land of Egypt by their companies under the leadership of Moses and Aaron
Moses wrote down their starting places stage by stage by command of the LORD and these are their stages according to their starting places
They set out from Rameses in the first month on the fifteenth day of the first month On the day after the Passover the people of Israel went out triumphantly in the sight of all the Egyptians
while the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn whom the LORD had struck down among them On their gods also the LORD executed judgments
So the people of Israel set out from Rameses and camped at Succoth
And they set out from Succoth and camped at Etham which is on the edge of the wilderness
And they set out from Etham and turned back to Pi hahiroth which is east of Baal zephon and they camped before Migdol

And Aaron the priest went up Mount Hor at the command of the LORD and died there in the fortieth year after the people of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt on the first day of the fifth month
And Aaron was years old when he died on Mount Hor

And they set out from the mountains of Abarim and camped in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho
they camped by the Jordan from Beth jeshimoth as far as Abel shittim in the plains of Moab
And the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho saying
Speak to the people of Israel and say to them When you pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan
then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you and destroy all their figured stones and destroy all their metal images and demolish all their high places
And you shall take possession of the land and settle in it for I have given the land to you to possess it
You shall inherit the land by lot according to your clans To a large tribe you shall give a large inheritance and to a small tribe you shall give a small inheritance Wherever the lot falls for anyone that shall be his According to the tribes of your fathers you shall inherit
But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you then those of them whom you let remain shall be as barbs in your eyes and thorns in your sides and they shall trouble you in the land where you dwell
And I will do to you as I thought to do to them
