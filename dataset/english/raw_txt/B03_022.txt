Luke 22
Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread drew near which is called the Passover
And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to put him to death for they feared the people
Then Satan entered into Judas called Iscariot who was of the number of the twelve
He went away and conferred with the chief priests and officers how he might betray him to them
And they were glad and agreed to give him money
So he consented and sought an opportunity to betray him to them in the absence of a crowd
Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed
So Jesus sent Peter and John saying Go and prepare the Passover for us that we may eat it
They said to him Where will you have us prepare it
He said to them Behold when you have entered the city a man carrying a jar of water will meet you Follow him into the house that he enters
and tell the master of the house The Teacher says to you Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples
And he will show you a large upper room furnished prepare it there
And they went and found it just as he had told them and they prepared the Passover
And when the hour came he reclined at table and the apostles with him
And he said to them I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer
For I tell you I will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God
And he took a cup and when he had given thanks he said Take this and divide it among yourselves
For I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes
And he took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and gave it to them saying This is my body which is given for you Do this in remembrance of me
And likewise the cup after they had eaten saying This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood
But behold the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table
For the Son of Man goes as it has been determined but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed
And they began to question one another which of them it could be who was going to do this
A dispute also arose among them as to which of them was to be regarded as the greatest
And he said to them The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them and those in authority over them are called benefactors
But not so with you Rather let the greatest among you become as the youngest and the leader as one who serves
For who is the greater one who reclines at table or one who serves Is it not the one who reclines at table But I am among you as the one who serves
You are those who have stayed with me in my trials
and I assign to you as my Father assigned to me a kingdom
that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel
Simon Simon behold Satan demanded to have you that he might sift you like wheat
but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail And when you have turned again strengthen your brothers
Peter said to him Lord I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death
Jesus said I tell you Peter the rooster will not crow this day until you deny three times that you know me
And he said to them When I sent you out with no moneybag or knapsack or sandals did you lack anything They said Nothing
He said to them But now let the one who has a moneybag take it and likewise a knapsack And let the one who has no sword sell his cloak and buy one
For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in me And he was numbered with the transgressors For what is written about me has its fulfillment
And they said Look Lord here are two swords And he said to them It is enough
And he came out and went as was his custom to the Mount of Olives and the disciples followed him
And when he came to the place he said to them Pray that you may not enter into temptation
And he withdrew from them about a stone s throw and knelt down and prayed
saying Father if you are willing remove this cup from me Nevertheless not my will but yours be done
And there appeared to him an angel from heaven strengthening him
And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground
And when he rose from prayer he came to the disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow
and he said to them Why are you sleeping Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation
While he was still speaking there came a crowd and the man called Judas one of the twelve was leading them He drew near to Jesus to kiss him
but Jesus said to him Judas would you betray the Son of Man with a kiss
And when those who were around him saw what would follow they said Lord shall we strike with the sword
And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear
But Jesus said No more of this And he touched his ear and healed him
Then Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders who had come out against him Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs
When I was with you day after day in the temple you did not lay hands on me But this is your hour and the power of darkness
Then they seized him and led him away bringing him into the high priest s house and Peter was following at a distance
And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together Peter sat down among them
Then a servant girl seeing him as he sat in the light and looking closely at him said This man also was with him
But he denied it saying Woman I do not know him
And a little later someone else saw him and said You also are one of them But Peter said Man I am not
And after an interval of about an hour still another insisted saying Certainly this man also was with him for he too is a Galilean
But Peter said Man I do not know what you are talking about And immediately while he was still speaking the rooster crowed
And the Lord turned and looked at Peter And Peter remembered the saying of the Lord how he had said to him Before the rooster crows today you will deny me three times
And he went out and wept bitterly
Now the men who were holding Jesus in custody were mocking him as they beat him
They also blindfolded him and kept asking him Prophesy Who is it that struck you
And they said many other things against him blaspheming him
When day came the assembly of the elders of the people gathered together both chief priests and scribes And they led him away to their council and they said
If you are the Christ tell us But he said to them If I tell you you will not believe
and if I ask you you will not answer
But from now on the Son of Man shall be seated at the right hand of the power of God
So they all said Are you the Son of God then And he said to them You say that I am
Then they said What further testimony do we need We have heard it ourselves from his own lips
