1 Peter 3
Likewise wives be subject to your own husbands so that even if some do not obey the word they may be won without a word by the conduct of their wives
when they see your respectful and pure conduct
Do not let your adorning be external the braiding of hair and the putting on of gold jewelry or the clothing you wear
but let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit which in God s sight is very precious
For this is how the holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves by submitting to their own husbands
as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him lord And you are her children if you do good and do not fear anything that is frightening
Likewise husbands live with your wives in an understanding way showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel since they are heirs with you of the grace of life so that your prayers may not be hindered
Finally all of you have unity of mind sympathy brotherly love a tender heart and a humble mind
Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling but on the contrary bless for to this you were called that you may obtain a blessing
For Whoever desires to love life and see good days let him keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit
let him turn away from evil and do good let him seek peace and pursue it
For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears are open to their prayer But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil
Now who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good
But even if you should suffer for righteousness sake you will be blessed Have no fear of them nor be troubled
but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you yet do it with gentleness and respect
having a good conscience so that when you are slandered those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame
For it is better to suffer for doing good if that should be God s will than for doing evil
For Christ also suffered once for sins the righteous for the unrighteous that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit
in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison
because they formerly did not obey when God s patience waited in the days of Noah while the ark was being prepared in which a few that is eight persons were brought safely through water
Baptism which corresponds to this now saves you not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience through the resurrection of Jesus Christ
who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God with angels authorities and powers having been subjected to him
