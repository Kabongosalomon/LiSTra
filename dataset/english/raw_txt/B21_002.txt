1 Peter 2
So put away all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander
Like newborn infants long for the pure spiritual milk that by it you may grow up into salvation
if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good
As you come to him a living stone rejected by men but in the sight of God chosen and precious
you yourselves like living stones are being built up as a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ
For it stands in Scripture Behold I am laying in Zion a stone a cornerstone chosen and precious and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame
So the honor is for you who believe but for those who do not believe The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone
and A stone of stumbling and a rock of offense They stumble because they disobey the word as they were destined to do
But you are a chosen race a royal priesthood a holy nation a people for his own possession that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light
Once you were not a people but now you are God s people once you had not received mercy but now you have received mercy
Beloved I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh which wage war against your soul
Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable so that when they speak against you as evildoers they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation
Be subject for the Lord s sake to every human institution whether it be to the emperor as supreme
or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good
For this is the will of God that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish people
Live as people who are free not using your freedom as a cover up for evil but living as servants of God
Honor everyone Love the brotherhood Fear God Honor the emperor
Servants be subject to your masters with all respect not only to the good and gentle but also to the unjust
For this is a gracious thing when mindful of God one endures sorrows while suffering unjustly
For what credit is it if when you sin and are beaten for it you endure But if when you do good and suffer for it you endure this is a gracious thing in the sight of God
For to this you have been called because Christ also suffered for you leaving you an example so that you might follow in his steps
He committed no sin neither was deceit found in his mouth
When he was reviled he did not revile in return when he suffered he did not threaten but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly
He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree that we might die to sin and live to righteousness By his wounds you have been healed
For you were straying like sheep but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls
