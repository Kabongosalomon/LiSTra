Isaiah 25
O LORD you are my God I will exalt you I will praise your name for you have done wonderful things plans formed of old faithful and sure
For you have made the city a heap the fortified city a ruin the foreigners palace is a city no more it will never be rebuilt
Therefore strong peoples will glorify you cities of ruthless nations will fear you
For you have been a stronghold to the poor a stronghold to the needy in his distress a shelter from the storm and a shade from the heat for the breath of the ruthless is like a storm against a wall
like heat in a dry place You subdue the noise of the foreigners as heat by the shade of a cloud so the song of the ruthless is put down
On this mountain the LORD of hosts will make for all peoples a feast of rich food a feast of well aged wine of rich food full of marrow of aged wine well refined
And he will swallow up on this mountain the covering that is cast over all peoples the veil that is spread over all nations
He will swallow up death forever and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from all faces and the reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth for the LORD has spoken
It will be said on that day Behold this is our God we have waited for him that he might save us This is the LORD we have waited for him let us be glad and rejoice in his salvation
For the hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain and Moab shall be trampled down in his place as straw is trampled down in a dunghill
And he will spread out his hands in the midst of it as a swimmer spreads his hands out to swim but the LORD will lay low his pompous pride together with the skill of his hands
And the high fortifications of his walls he will bring down lay low and cast to the ground to the dust
