Proverbs 25
These also are proverbs of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied
It is the glory of God to conceal things but the glory of kings is to search things out
As the heavens for height and the earth for depth so the heart of kings is unsearchable
Take away the dross from the silver and the smith has material for a vessel
take away the wicked from the presence of the king and his throne will be established in righteousness
Do not put yourself forward in the king s presence or stand in the place of the great
for it is better to be told Come up here than to be put lower in the presence of a noble What your eyes have seen
do not hastily bring into court for what will you do in the end when your neighbor puts you to shame
Argue your case with your neighbor himself and do not reveal another s secret
lest he who hears you bring shame upon you and your ill repute have no end
A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in a setting of silver
Like a gold ring or an ornament of gold is a wise reprover to a listening ear
Like the cold of snow in the time of harvest is a faithful messenger to those who send him he refreshes the soul of his masters
Like clouds and wind without rain is a man who boasts of a gift he does not give
With patience a ruler may be persuaded and a soft tongue will break a bone
If you have found honey eat only enough for you lest you have your fill of it and vomit it
Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor s house lest he have his fill of you and hate you
A man who bears false witness against his neighbor is like a war club or a sword or a sharp arrow
Trusting in a treacherous man in time of trouble is like a bad tooth or a foot that slips
Whoever sings songs to a heavy heart is like one who takes off a garment on a cold day and like vinegar on soda
If your enemy is hungry give him bread to eat and if he is thirsty give him water to drink
for you will heap burning coals on his head and the LORD will reward you
The north wind brings forth rain and a backbiting tongue angry looks
It is better to live in a corner of the housetop than in a house shared with a quarrelsome wife
Like cold water to a thirsty soul so is good news from a far country
Like a muddied spring or a polluted fountain is a righteous man who gives way before the wicked
It is not good to eat much honey nor is it glorious to seek one s own glory
A man without self control is like a city broken into and left without walls
