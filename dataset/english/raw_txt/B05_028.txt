Acts 28
After we were brought safely through we then learned that the island was called Malta
The native people showed us unusual kindness for they kindled a fire and welcomed us all because it had begun to rain and was cold
When Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and put them on the fire a viper came out because of the heat and fastened on his hand
When the native people saw the creature hanging from his hand they said to one another No doubt this man is a murderer Though he has escaped from the sea Justice has not allowed him to live
He however shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no harm
They were waiting for him to swell up or suddenly fall down dead But when they had waited a long time and saw no misfortune come to him they changed their minds and said that he was a god
Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island named Publius who received us and entertained us hospitably for three days
It happened that the father of Publius lay sick with fever and dysentery And Paul visited him and prayed and putting his hands on him healed him
And when this had taken place the rest of the people on the island who had diseases also came and were cured
They also honored us greatly and when we were about to sail they put on board whatever we needed
After three months we set sail in a ship that had wintered in the island a ship of Alexandria with the twin gods as a figurehead
Putting in at Syracuse we stayed there for three days
And from there we made a circuit and arrived at Rhegium And after one day a south wind sprang up and on the second day we came to Puteoli
There we found brothers and were invited to stay with them for seven days And so we came to Rome
And the brothers there when they heard about us came as far as the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns to meet us On seeing them Paul thanked God and took courage
And when we came into Rome Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier that guarded him
After three days he called together the local leaders of the Jews and when they had gathered he said to them Brothers though I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers yet I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans
When they had examined me they wished to set me at liberty because there was no reason for the death penalty in my case
But because the Jews objected I was compelled to appeal to Caesar though I had no charge to bring against my nation
For this reason therefore I have asked to see you and speak with you since it is because of the hope of Israel that I am wearing this chain
And they said to him We have received no letters from Judea about you and none of the brothers coming here has reported or spoken any evil about you
But we desire to hear from you what your views are for with regard to this sect we know that everywhere it is spoken against
When they had appointed a day for him they came to him at his lodging in greater numbers From morning till evening he expounded to them testifying to the kingdom of God and trying to convince them about Jesus both from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets
And some were convinced by what he said but others disbelieved
And disagreeing among themselves they departed after Paul had made one statement The Holy Spirit was right in saying to your fathers through Isaiah the prophet
Go to this people and say You will indeed hear but never understand and you will indeed see but never perceive
For this people s heart has grown dull and with their ears they can barely hear and their eyes they have closed lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn and I would heal them
Therefore let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles they will listen
He lived there two whole years at his own expense and welcomed all who came to him
proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance
