Mark 12
And he began to speak to them in parables A man planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a pit for the winepress and built a tower and leased it to tenants and went into another country
When the season came he sent a servant to the tenants to get from them some of the fruit of the vineyard
And they took him and beat him and sent him away empty handed
Again he sent to them another servant and they struck him on the head and treated him shamefully
And he sent another and him they killed And so with many others some they beat and some they killed
He had still one other a beloved son Finally he sent him to them saying They will respect my son
But those tenants said to one another This is the heir Come let us kill him and the inheritance will be ours
And they took him and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard
What will the owner of the vineyard do He will come and destroy the tenants and give the vineyard to others
Have you not read this Scripture The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone
this was the Lord s doing and it is marvelous in our eyes
And they were seeking to arrest him but feared the people for they perceived that he had told the parable against them So they left him and went away
And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and some of the Herodians to trap him in his talk
And they came and said to him Teacher we know that you are true and do not care about anyone s opinion For you are not swayed by appearances but truly teach the way of God Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not Should we pay them or should we not
But knowing their hypocrisy he said to them Why put me to the test Bring me a denarius and let me look at it
And they brought one And he said to them Whose likeness and inscription is this They said to him Caesar s
Jesus said to them Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar s and to God the things that are God s And they marveled at him
And Sadducees came to him who say that there is no resurrection And they asked him a question saying
Teacher Moses wrote for us that if a man s brother dies and leaves a wife but leaves no child the man must take the widow and raise up offspring for his brother
There were seven brothers the first took a wife and when he died left no offspring
And the second took her and died leaving no offspring And the third likewise
And the seven left no offspring Last of all the woman also died
In the resurrection when they rise again whose wife will she be For the seven had her as wife
Jesus said to them Is this not the reason you are wrong because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God
For when they rise from the dead they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are like angels in heaven
And as for the dead being raised have you not read in the book of Moses in the passage about the bush how God spoke to him saying I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob
He is not God of the dead but of the living You are quite wrong
And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another and seeing that he answered them well asked him Which commandment is the most important of all
Jesus answered The most important is Hear O Israel The Lord our God the Lord is one
And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength
The second is this You shall love your neighbor as yourself There is no other commandment greater than these
And the scribe said to him You are right Teacher You have truly said that he is one and there is no other besides him
And to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength and to love one s neighbor as oneself is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices
And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely he said to him You are not far from the kingdom of God And after that no one dared to ask him any more questions
And as Jesus taught in the temple he said How can the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David
David himself in the Holy Spirit declared The Lord said to my Lord Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet
David himself calls him Lord So how is he his son And the great throng heard him gladly
And in his teaching he said Beware of the scribes who like to walk around in long robes and like greetings in the marketplaces
and have the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts
who devour widows houses and for a pretense make long prayers They will receive the greater condemnation
And he sat down opposite the treasury and watched the people putting money into the offering box Many rich people put in large sums
And a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins which make a penny
And he called his disciples to him and said to them Truly I say to you this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the offering box
For they all contributed out of their abundance but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had all she had to live on
