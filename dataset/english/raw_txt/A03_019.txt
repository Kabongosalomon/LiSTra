Do not turn to idols or make for yourselves any gods of cast metal I am the LORD your God
When you offer a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD you shall offer it so that you may be accepted
It shall be eaten the same day you offer it or on the day after and anything left over until the third day shall be burned up with fire
If it is eaten at all on the third day it is tainted it will not be accepted
and everyone who eats it shall bear his iniquity because he has profaned what is holy to the LORD and that person shall be cut off from his people
When you reap the harvest of your land you shall not reap your field right up to its edge neither shall you gather the gleanings after your harvest
And you shall not strip your vineyard bare neither shall you gather the fallen grapes of your vineyard You shall leave them for the poor and for the sojourner I am the LORD your God

You shall not swear by my name falsely and so profane the name of your God I am the LORD
You shall not oppress your neighbor or rob him The wages of a hired servant shall not remain with you all night until the morning

If a man lies sexually with a woman who is a slave assigned to another man and not yet ransomed or given her freedom a distinction shall be made They shall not be put to death because she was not free
but he shall bring his compensation to the LORD to the entrance of the tent of meeting a ram for a guilt offering
And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering before the LORD for his sin that he has committed and he shall be forgiven for the sin that he has committed
When you come into the land and plant any kind of tree for food then you shall regard its fruit as forbidden Three years it shall be forbidden to you it must not be eaten
