Numbers 15
The LORD spoke to Moses saying
Speak to the people of Israel and say to them When you come into the land you are to inhabit which I am giving you
and you offer to the LORD from the herd or from the flock a food offering or a burnt offering or a sacrifice to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering or at your appointed feasts to make a pleasing aroma to the LORD
then he who brings his offering shall offer to the LORD a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a quarter of a hin of oil
and you shall offer with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice a quarter of a hin of wine for the drink offering for each lamb
Or for a ram you shall offer for a grain offering two tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a third of a hin of oil
And for the drink offering you shall offer a third of a hin of wine a pleasing aroma to the LORD
And when you offer a bull as a burnt offering or sacrifice to fulfill a vow or for peace offerings to the LORD
then one shall offer with the bull a grain offering of three tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil
And you shall offer for the drink offering half a hin of wine as a food offering a pleasing aroma to the LORD
Thus it shall be done for each bull or ram or for each lamb or young goat
As many as you offer so shall you do with each one as many as there are
Every native Israelite shall do these things in this way in offering a food offering with a pleasing aroma to the LORD
And if a stranger is sojourning with you or anyone is living permanently among you and he wishes to offer a food offering with a pleasing aroma to the LORD he shall do as you do
For the assembly there shall be one statute for you and for the stranger who sojourns with you a statute forever throughout your generations You and the sojourner shall be alike before the LORD
One law and one rule shall be for you and for the stranger who sojourns with you
The LORD spoke to Moses saying
Speak to the people of Israel and say to them When you come into the land to which I bring you
and when you eat of the bread of the land you shall present a contribution to the LORD
Of the first of your dough you shall present a loaf as a contribution like a contribution from the threshing floor so shall you present it
Some of the first of your dough you shall give to the LORD as a contribution throughout your generations
But if you sin unintentionally and do not observe all these commandments that the LORD has spoken to Moses
all that the LORD has commanded you by Moses from the day that the LORD gave commandment and onward throughout your generations
then if it was done unintentionally without the knowledge of the congregation all the congregation shall offer one bull from the herd for a burnt offering a pleasing aroma to the LORD with its grain offering and its drink offering according to the rule and one male goat for a sin offering
And the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the people of Israel and they shall be forgiven because it was a mistake and they have brought their offering a food offering to the LORD and their sin offering before the LORD for their mistake
And all the congregation of the people of Israel shall be forgiven and the stranger who sojourns among them because the whole population was involved in the mistake
If one person sins unintentionally he shall offer a female goat a year old for a sin offering
And the priest shall make atonement before the LORD for the person who makes a mistake when he sins unintentionally to make atonement for him and he shall be forgiven
You shall have one law for him who does anything unintentionally for him who is native among the people of Israel and for the stranger who sojourns among them
But the person who does anything with a high hand whether he is native or a sojourner reviles the LORD and that person shall be cut off from among his people
Because he has despised the word of the LORD and has broken his commandment that person shall be utterly cut off his iniquity shall be on him
While the people of Israel were in the wilderness they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day
And those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation
They put him in custody because it had not been made clear what should be done to him
And the LORD said to Moses The man shall be put to death all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside the camp
And all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him to death with stones as the LORD commanded Moses
The LORD said to Moses
Speak to the people of Israel and tell them to make tassels on the corners of their garments throughout their generations and to put a cord of blue on the tassel of each corner
And it shall be a tassel for you to look at and remember all the commandments of the LORD to do them not to follow after your own heart and your own eyes which you are inclined to whore after
So you shall remember and do all my commandments and be holy to your God
I am the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God I am the LORD your God
