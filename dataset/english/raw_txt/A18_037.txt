Job 37
At this also my heart trembles and leaps out of its place
Keep listening to the thunder of his voice and the rumbling that comes from his mouth
Under the whole heaven he lets it go and his lightning to the corners of the earth
After it his voice roars he thunders with his majestic voice and he does not restrain the lightnings when his voice is heard
God thunders wondrously with his voice he does great things that we cannot comprehend
For to the snow he says Fall on the earth likewise to the downpour his mighty downpour
He seals up the hand of every man that all men whom he made may know it
Then the beasts go into their lairs and remain in their dens
From its chamber comes the whirlwind and cold from the scattering winds
By the breath of God ice is given and the broad waters are frozen fast
He loads the thick cloud with moisture the clouds scatter his lightning
They turn around and around by his guidance to accomplish all that he commands them on the face of the habitable world
Whether for correction or for his land or for love he causes it to happen
Hear this O Job stop and consider the wondrous works of God
Do you know how God lays his command upon them and causes the lightning of his cloud to shine
Do you know the balancings of the clouds the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge
you whose garments are hot when the earth is still because of the south wind
Can you like him spread out the skies hard as a cast metal mirror
Teach us what we shall say to him we cannot draw up our case because of darkness
Shall it be told him that I would speak Did a man ever wish that he would be swallowed up
And now no one looks on the light when it is bright in the skies when the wind has passed and cleared them
Out of the north comes golden splendor God is clothed with awesome majesty
The Almighty we cannot find him he is great in power justice and abundant righteousness he will not violate
Therefore men fear him he does not regard any who are wise in their own conceit
