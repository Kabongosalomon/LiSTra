John 11
Now a certain man was ill Lazarus of Bethany the village of Mary and her sister Martha
It was Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother Lazarus was ill
So the sisters sent to him saying Lord he whom you love is ill
But when Jesus heard it he said This illness does not lead to death It is for the glory of God so that the Son of God may be glorified through it
Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus
So when he heard that Lazarus was ill he stayed two days longer in the place where he was
Then after this he said to the disciples Let us go to Judea again
The disciples said to him Rabbi the Jews were just now seeking to stone you and are you going there again
Jesus answered Are there not twelve hours in the day If anyone walks in the day he does not stumble because he sees the light of this world
But if anyone walks in the night he stumbles because the light is not in him
After saying these things he said to them Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep but I go to awaken him
The disciples said to him Lord if he has fallen asleep he will recover
Now Jesus had spoken of his death but they thought that he meant taking rest in sleep
Then Jesus told them plainly Lazarus has died
and for your sake I am glad that I was not there so that you may believe But let us go to him
So Thomas called the Twin said to his fellow disciples Let us also go that we may die with him
Now when Jesus came he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days
Bethany was near Jerusalem about two miles off
and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother
So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming she went and met him but Mary remained seated in the house
Martha said to Jesus Lord if you had been here my brother would not have died
But even now I know that whatever you ask from God God will give you
Jesus said to her Your brother will rise again
Martha said to him I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day
Jesus said to her I am the resurrection and the life Whoever believes in me though he die yet shall he live
and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die Do you believe this
She said to him Yes Lord I believe that you are the Christ the Son of God who is coming into the world
When she had said this she went and called her sister Mary saying in private The Teacher is here and is calling for you
And when she heard it she rose quickly and went to him
Now Jesus had not yet come into the village but was still in the place where Martha had met him
When the Jews who were with her in the house consoling her saw Mary rise quickly and go out they followed her supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there
Now when Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him she fell at his feet saying to him Lord if you had been here my brother would not have died
When Jesus saw her weeping and the Jews who had come with her also weeping he was deeply moved in his spirit and greatly troubled
And he said Where have you laid him They said to him Lord come and see
Jesus wept
So the Jews said See how he loved him
But some of them said Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man also have kept this man from dying
Then Jesus deeply moved again came to the tomb It was a cave and a stone lay against it
Jesus said Take away the stone Martha the sister of the dead man said to him Lord by this time there will be an odor for he has been dead four days
Jesus said to her Did I not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God
So they took away the stone And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said Father I thank you that you have heard me
I knew that you always hear me but I said this on account of the people standing around that they may believe that you sent me
When he had said these things he cried out with a loud voice Lazarus come out
The man who had died came out his hands and feet bound with linen strips and his face wrapped with a cloth Jesus said to them Unbind him and let him go
Many of the Jews therefore who had come with Mary and had seen what he did believed in him
but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done
So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the Council and said What are we to do For this man performs many signs
If we let him go on like this everyone will believe in him and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation
But one of them Caiaphas who was high priest that year said to them You know nothing at all
Nor do you understand that it is better for you that one man should die for the people not that the whole nation should perish
He did not say this of his own accord but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation
and not for the nation only but also to gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad
So from that day on they made plans to put him to death
Jesus therefore no longer walked openly among the Jews but went from there to the region near the wilderness to a town called Ephraim and there he stayed with the disciples
Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand and many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover to purify themselves
They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple What do you think That he will not come to the feast at all
Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where he was he should let them know so that they might arrest him
