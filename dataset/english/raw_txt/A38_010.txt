Zechariah 10
Ask rain from the LORD in the season of the spring rain from the LORD who makes the storm clouds and he will give them showers of rain to everyone the vegetation in the field
For the household gods utter nonsense and the diviners see lies they tell false dreams and give empty consolation Therefore the people wander like sheep they are afflicted for lack of a shepherd
My anger is hot against the shepherds and I will punish the leaders for the LORD of hosts cares for his flock the house of Judah and will make them like his majestic steed in battle
From him shall come the cornerstone from him the tent peg from him the battle bow from him every ruler all of them together
They shall be like mighty men in battle trampling the foe in the mud of the streets they shall fight because the LORD is with them and they shall put to shame the riders on horses
I will strengthen the house of Judah and I will save the house of Joseph I will bring them back because I have compassion on them and they shall be as though I had not rejected them for I am the LORD their God and I will answer them
Then Ephraim shall become like a mighty warrior and their hearts shall be glad as with wine Their children shall see it and be glad their hearts shall rejoice in the LORD
I will whistle for them and gather them in for I have redeemed them and they shall be as many as they were before
Though I scattered them among the nations yet in far countries they shall remember me and with their children they shall live and return
I will bring them home from the land of Egypt and gather them from Assyria and I will bring them to the land of Gilead and to Lebanon till there is no room for them
He shall pass through the sea of troubles and strike down the waves of the sea and all the depths of the Nile shall be dried up The pride of Assyria shall be laid low and the scepter of Egypt shall depart
I will make them strong in the LORD and they shall walk in his name declares the LORD
