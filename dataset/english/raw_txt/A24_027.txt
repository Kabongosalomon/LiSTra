Jeremiah 27
In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD
Thus the LORD said to me Make yourself straps and yoke bars and put them on your neck
Send word to the king of Edom the king of Moab the king of the sons of Ammon the king of Tyre and the king of Sidon by the hand of the envoys who have come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah
Give them this charge for their masters Thus says the LORD of hosts the God of Israel This is what you shall say to your masters
It is I who by my great power and my outstretched arm have made the earth with the men and animals that are on the earth and I give it to whomever it seems right to me
Now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon my servant and I have given him also the beasts of the field to serve him
All the nations shall serve him and his son and his grandson until the time of his own land comes Then many nations and great kings shall make him their slave
But if any nation or kingdom will not serve this Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon I will punish that nation with the sword with famine and with pestilence declares the LORD until I have consumed it by his hand
So do not listen to your prophets your diviners your dreamers your fortune tellers or your sorcerers who are saying to you You shall not serve the king of Babylon
For it is a lie that they are prophesying to you with the result that you will be removed far from your land and I will drive you out and you will perish
But any nation that will bring its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him I will leave on its own land to work it and dwell there declares the LORD
To Zedekiah king of Judah I spoke in like manner Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him and his people and live
Why will you and your people die by the sword by famine and by pestilence as the LORD has spoken concerning any nation that will not serve the king of Babylon
Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are saying to you You shall not serve the king of Babylon for it is a lie that they are prophesying to you
I have not sent them declares the LORD but they are prophesying falsely in my name with the result that I will drive you out and you will perish you and the prophets who are prophesying to you
Then I spoke to the priests and to all this people saying Thus says the LORD Do not listen to the words of your prophets who are prophesying to you saying Behold the vessels of the LORD s house will now shortly be brought back from Babylon for it is a lie that they are prophesying to you
Do not listen to them serve the king of Babylon and live Why should this city become a desolation
If they are prophets and if the word of the LORD is with them then let them intercede with the LORD of hosts that the vessels that are left in the house of the LORD in the house of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem may not go to Babylon
For thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars the sea the stands and the rest of the vessels that are left in this city
which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take away when he took into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem
thus says the LORD of hosts the God of Israel concerning the vessels that are left in the house of the LORD in the house of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem
They shall be carried to Babylon and remain there until the day when I visit them declares the LORD Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place
