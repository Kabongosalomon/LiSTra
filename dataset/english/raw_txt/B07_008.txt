1 Corienthians 8
Now concerning food offered to idols we know that all of us possess knowledge This knowledge puffs up but love builds up
If anyone imagines that he knows something he does not yet know as he ought to know
But if anyone loves God he is known by God
Therefore as to the eating of food offered to idols we know that an idol has no real existence and that there is no God but one
For although there may be so called gods in heaven or on earth as indeed there are many gods and many lords
yet for us there is one God the Father from whom are all things and for whom we exist and one Lord Jesus Christ through whom are all things and through whom we exist
However not all possess this knowledge But some through former association with idols eat food as really offered to an idol and their conscience being weak is defiled
Food will not commend us to God We are no worse off if we do not eat and no better off if we do
But take care that this right of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak
For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idol s temple will he not be encouraged if his conscience is weak to eat food offered to idols
And so by your knowledge this weak person is destroyed the brother for whom Christ died
Thus sinning against your brothers and wounding their conscience when it is weak you sin against Christ
Therefore if food makes my brother stumble I will never eat meat lest I make my brother stumble
