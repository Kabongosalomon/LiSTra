Job 12
Then Job answered and said
No doubt you are the people and wisdom will die with you
But I have understanding as well as you I am not inferior to you Who does not know such things as these
I am a laughingstock to my friends I who called to God and he answered me a just and blameless man am a laughingstock
In the thought of one who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune it is ready for those whose feet slip
The tents of robbers are at peace and those who provoke God are secure who bring their god in their hand
But ask the beasts and they will teach you the birds of the heavens and they will tell you
or the bushes of the earth and they will teach you and the fish of the sea will declare to you
Who among all these does not know that the hand of the LORD has done this
In his hand is the life of every living thing and the breath of all mankind
Does not the ear test words as the palate tastes food
Wisdom is with the aged and understanding in length of days
With God are wisdom and might he has counsel and understanding
If he tears down none can rebuild if he shuts a man in none can open
If he withholds the waters they dry up if he sends them out they overwhelm the land
With him are strength and sound wisdom the deceived and the deceiver are his
He leads counselors away stripped and judges he makes fools
He looses the bonds of kings and binds a waistcloth on their hips
He leads priests away stripped and overthrows the mighty
He deprives of speech those who are trusted and takes away the discernment of the elders
He pours contempt on princes and loosens the belt of the strong
He uncovers the deeps out of darkness and brings deep darkness to light
He makes nations great and he destroys them he enlarges nations and leads them away
He takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth and makes them wander in a pathless waste
They grope in the dark without light and he makes them stagger like a drunken man
