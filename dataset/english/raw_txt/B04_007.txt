John 7
After this Jesus went about in Galilee He would not go about in Judea because the Jews were seeking to kill him
Now the Jews Feast of Booths was at hand
So his brothers said to him Leave here and go to Judea that your disciples also may see the works you are doing
For no one works in secret if he seeks to be known openly If you do these things show yourself to the world
For not even his brothers believed in him
Jesus said to them My time has not yet come but your time is always here
The world cannot hate you but it hates me because I testify about it that its works are evil
You go up to the feast I am not going up to this feast for my time has not yet fully come
After saying this he remained in Galilee
But after his brothers had gone up to the feast then he also went up not publicly but in private
The Jews were looking for him at the feast and saying Where is he
And there was much muttering about him among the people While some said He is a good man others said No he is leading the people astray
Yet for fear of the Jews no one spoke openly of him
About the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and began teaching
The Jews therefore marveled saying How is it that this man has learning when he has never studied
So Jesus answered them My teaching is not mine but his who sent me
If anyone s will is to do God s will he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority
The one who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory but the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true and in him there is no falsehood
Has not Moses given you the law Yet none of you keeps the law Why do you seek to kill me
The crowd answered You have a demon Who is seeking to kill you
Jesus answered them I did one work and you all marvel at it
Moses gave you circumcision not that it is from Moses but from the fathers and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath
If on the Sabbath a man receives circumcision so that the law of Moses may not be broken are you angry with me because on the Sabbath I made a man s whole body well
Do not judge by appearances but judge with right judgment
Some of the people of Jerusalem therefore said Is not this the man whom they seek to kill
And here he is speaking openly and they say nothing to him Can it be that the authorities really know that this is the Christ
But we know where this man comes from and when the Christ appears no one will know where he comes from
So Jesus proclaimed as he taught in the temple You know me and you know where I come from But I have not come of my own accord He who sent me is true and him you do not know
I know him for I come from him and he sent me
So they were seeking to arrest him but no one laid a hand on him because his hour had not yet come
Yet many of the people believed in him They said When the Christ appears will he do more signs than this man has done
The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about him and the chief priests and Pharisees sent officers to arrest him
Jesus then said I will be with you a little longer and then I am going to him who sent me
You will seek me and you will not find me Where I am you cannot come
The Jews said to one another Where does this man intend to go that we will not find him Does he intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks
What does he mean by saying You will seek me and you will not find me and Where I am you cannot come
On the last day of the feast the great day Jesus stood up and cried out If anyone thirsts let him come to me and drink
Whoever believes in me as the Scripture has said Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water
Now this he said about the Spirit whom those who believed in him were to receive for as yet the Spirit had not been given because Jesus was not yet glorified
When they heard these words some of the people said This really is the Prophet
Others said This is the Christ But some said Is the Christ to come from Galilee
Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes from the offspring of David and comes from Bethlehem the village where David was
So there was a division among the people over him
Some of them wanted to arrest him but no one laid hands on him
The officers then came to the chief priests and Pharisees who said to them Why did you not bring him
The officers answered No one ever spoke like this man
The Pharisees answered them Have you also been deceived
Have any of the authorities or the Pharisees believed in him
But this crowd that does not know the law is accursed
Nicodemus who had gone to him before and who was one of them said to them
Does our law judge a man without first giving him a hearing and learning what he does
They replied Are you from Galilee too Search and see that no prophet arises from Galilee THE EARLIEST MANUSCRIPTS DO NOT INCLUDE
They went each to his own house
