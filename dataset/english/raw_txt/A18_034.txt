Job 34
Then Elihu answered and said
Hear my words you wise men and give ear to me you who know
for the ear tests words as the palate tastes food
Let us choose what is right let us know among ourselves what is good
For Job has said I am in the right and God has taken away my right
in spite of my right I am counted a liar my wound is incurable though I am without transgression
What man is like Job who drinks up scoffing like water
who travels in company with evildoers and walks with wicked men
For he has said It profits a man nothing that he should take delight in God
Therefore hear me you men of understanding far be it from God that he should do wickedness and from the Almighty that he should do wrong
For according to the work of a man he will repay him and according to his ways he will make it befall him
Of a truth God will not do wickedly and the Almighty will not pervert justice
Who gave him charge over the earth and who laid on him the whole world
If he should set his heart to it and gather to himself his spirit and his breath
all flesh would perish together and man would return to dust
If you have understanding hear this listen to what I say
Shall one who hates justice govern Will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty
who says to a king Worthless one and to nobles Wicked man
who shows no partiality to princes nor regards the rich more than the poor for they are all the work of his hands
In a moment they die at midnight the people are shaken and pass away and the mighty are taken away by no human hand
For his eyes are on the ways of a man and he sees all his steps
There is no gloom or deep darkness where evildoers may hide themselves
For God has no need to consider a man further that he should go before God in judgment
He shatters the mighty without investigation and sets others in their place
Thus knowing their works he overturns them in the night and they are crushed
He strikes them for their wickedness in a place for all to see
because they turned aside from following him and had no regard for any of his ways
so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him and he heard the cry of the afflicted
When he is quiet who can condemn When he hides his face who can behold him whether it be a nation or a man
that a godless man should not reign that he should not ensnare the people
For has anyone said to God I have borne punishment I will not offend any more
teach me what I do not see if I have done iniquity I will do it no more
Will he then make repayment to suit you because you reject it For you must choose and not I therefore declare what you know
Men of understanding will say to me and the wise man who hears me will say
Job speaks without knowledge his words are without insight
Would that Job were tried to the end because he answers like wicked men
For he adds rebellion to his sin he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against God
