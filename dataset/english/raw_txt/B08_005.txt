2 Corienthians 5
For we know that if the tent that is our earthly home is destroyed we have a building from God a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens
For in this tent we groan longing to put on our heavenly dwelling
if indeed by putting it on we may not be found naked
For while we are still in this tent we groan being burdened not that we would be unclothed but that we would be further clothed so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life
He who has prepared us for this very thing is God who has given us the Spirit as a guarantee
So we are always of good courage We know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord
for we walk by faith not by sight
Yes we are of good courage and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord
So whether we are at home or away we make it our aim to please him
For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body whether good or evil
Therefore knowing the fear of the Lord we persuade others But what we are is known to God and I hope it is known also to your conscience
We are not commending ourselves to you again but giving you cause to boast about us so that you may be able to answer those who boast about outward appearance and not about what is in the heart
For if we are beside ourselves it is for God if we are in our right mind it is for you
For the love of Christ controls us because we have concluded this that one has died for all therefore all have died
and he died for all that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised
From now on therefore we regard no one according to the flesh Even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh we regard him thus no longer
Therefore if anyone is in Christ he is a new creation The old has passed away behold the new has come
All this is from God who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation
that is in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself not counting their trespasses against them and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation
Therefore we are ambassadors for Christ God making his appeal through us We implore you on behalf of Christ be reconciled to God
For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin so that in him we might become the righteousness of God
