Ruth 1
In the days when the judges ruled there was a famine in the land and a man of Bethlehem in Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab he and his wife and his two sons
The name of the man was Elimelech and the name of his wife Naomi and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah They went into the country of Moab and remained there
But Elimelech the husband of Naomi died and she was left with her two sons
These took Moabite wives the name of the one was Orpah and the name of the other Ruth They lived there about ten years
and both Mahlon and Chilion died so that the woman was left without her two sons and her husband
Then she arose with her daughters in law to return from the country of Moab for she had heard in the fields of Moab that the LORD had visited his people and given them food
So she set out from the place where she was with her two daughters in law and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah
But Naomi said to her two daughters in law Go return each of you to her mother s house May the LORD deal kindly with you as you have dealt with the dead and with me
The LORD grant that you may find rest each of you in the house of her husband Then she kissed them and they lifted up their voices and wept
And they said to her No we will return with you to your people
But Naomi said Turn back my daughters why will you go with me Have I yet sons in my womb that they may become your husbands
Turn back my daughters go your way for I am too old to have a husband If I should say I have hope even if I should have a husband this night and should bear sons
would you therefore wait till they were grown Would you therefore refrain from marrying No my daughters for it is exceedingly bitter to me for your sake that the hand of the LORD has gone out against me
Then they lifted up their voices and wept again And Orpah kissed her mother in law but Ruth clung to her
And she said See your sister in law has gone back to her people and to her gods return after your sister in law
But Ruth said Do not urge me to leave you or to return from following you For where you go I will go and where you lodge I will lodge Your people shall be my people and your God my God
Where you die I will die and there will I be buried May the LORD do so to me and more also if anything but death parts me from you
And when Naomi saw that she was determined to go with her she said no more
So the two of them went on until they came to Bethlehem And when they came to Bethlehem the whole town was stirred because of them And the women said Is this Naomi
She said to them Do not call me Naomi call me Mara for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me
I went away full and the LORD has brought me back empty Why call me Naomi when the LORD has testified against me and the Almighty has brought calamity upon me
So Naomi returned and Ruth the Moabite her daughter in law with her who returned from the country of Moab And they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest
