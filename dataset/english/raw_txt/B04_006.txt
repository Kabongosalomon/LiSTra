John 6
After this Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee which is the Sea of Tiberias
And a large crowd was following him because they saw the signs that he was doing on the sick
Jesus went up on the mountain and there he sat down with his disciples
Now the Passover the feast of the Jews was at hand
Lifting up his eyes then and seeing that a large crowd was coming toward him Jesus said to Philip Where are we to buy bread so that these people may eat
He said this to test him for he himself knew what he would do
Philip answered him Two hundred denarii would not buy enough bread for each of them to get a little
One of his disciples Andrew Simon Peter s brother said to him
There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish but what are they for so many
Jesus said Have the people sit down Now there was much grass in the place So the men sat down about five thousand in number
Jesus then took the loaves and when he had given thanks he distributed them to those who were seated So also the fish as much as they wanted
And when they had eaten their fill he told his disciples Gather up the leftover fragments that nothing may be lost
So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves left by those who had eaten
When the people saw the sign that he had done they said This is indeed the Prophet who is to come into the world
Perceiving then that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king Jesus withdrew again to the mountain by himself
When evening came his disciples went down to the sea
got into a boat and started across the sea to Capernaum It was now dark and Jesus had not yet come to them
The sea became rough because a strong wind was blowing
When they had rowed about three or four miles they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat and they were frightened
But he said to them It is I do not be afraid
Then they were glad to take him into the boat and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going
On the next day the crowd that remained on the other side of the sea saw that there had been only one boat there and that Jesus had not entered the boat with his disciples but that his disciples had gone away alone
Other boats from Tiberias came near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks
So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there nor his disciples they themselves got into the boats and went to Capernaum seeking Jesus
When they found him on the other side of the sea they said to him Rabbi when did you come here
Jesus answered them Truly truly I say to you you are seeking me not because you saw signs but because you ate your fill of the loaves
Do not labor for the food that perishes but for the food that endures to eternal life which the Son of Man will give to you For on him God the Father has set his seal
Then they said to him What must we do to be doing the works of God
Jesus answered them This is the work of God that you believe in him whom he has sent
So they said to him Then what sign do you do that we may see and believe you What work do you perform
Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness as it is written He gave them bread from heaven to eat
Jesus then said to them Truly truly I say to you it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven
For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world
They said to him Sir give us this bread always
Jesus said to them I am the bread of life whoever comes to me shall not hunger and whoever believes in me shall never thirst
But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe
All that the Father gives me will come to me and whoever comes to me I will never cast out
For I have come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me
And this is the will of him who sent me that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me but raise it up on the last day
For this is the will of my Father that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life and I will raise him up on the last day
So the Jews grumbled about him because he said I am the bread that came down from heaven
They said Is not this Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know How does he now say I have come down from heaven
Jesus answered them Do not grumble among yourselves
No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him And I will raise him up on the last day
It is written in the Prophets And they will all be taught by God Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me
not that anyone has seen the Father except he who is from God he has seen the Father
Truly truly I say to you whoever believes has eternal life
I am the bread of life
Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness and they died
This is the bread that comes down from heaven so that one may eat of it and not die
I am the living bread that came down from heaven If anyone eats of this bread he will live forever And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh
The Jews then disputed among themselves saying How can this man give us his flesh to eat
So Jesus said to them Truly truly I say to you unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood you have no life in you
Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and I will raise him up on the last day
For my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink
Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me and I in him
As the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father so whoever feeds on me he also will live because of me
This is the bread that came down from heaven not like the bread the fathers ate and died Whoever feeds on this bread will live forever
Jesus said these things in the synagogue as he taught at Capernaum
When many of his disciples heard it they said This is a hard saying who can listen to it
But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples were grumbling about this said to them Do you take offense at this
Then what if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before
It is the Spirit who gives life the flesh is no help at all The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life
But there are some of you who do not believe For Jesus knew from the beginning who those were who did not believe and who it was who would betray him
And he said This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father
After this many of his disciples turned back and no longer walked with him
So Jesus said to the Twelve Do you want to go away as well
Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go You have the words of eternal life
and we have believed and have come to know that you are the Holy One of God
Jesus answered them Did I not choose you the Twelve And yet one of you is a devil
He spoke of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot for he one of the Twelve was going to betray him
