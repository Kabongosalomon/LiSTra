Leviticus 18
And the LORD spoke to Moses saying
Speak to the people of Israel and say to them I am the LORD your God
You shall not do as they do in the land of Egypt where you lived and you shall not do as they do in the land of Canaan to which I am bringing you You shall not walk in their statutes
You shall follow my rules and keep my statutes and walk in them I am the LORD your God
You shall therefore keep my statutes and my rules if a person does them he shall live by them I am the LORD
None of you shall approach any one of his close relatives to uncover nakedness I am the LORD
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father which is the nakedness of your mother she is your mother you shall not uncover her nakedness
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father s wife it is your father s nakedness
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your sister your father s daughter or your mother s daughter whether brought up in the family or in another home
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your son s daughter or of your daughter s daughter for their nakedness is your own nakedness
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father s wife s daughter brought up in your father s family since she is your sister
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father s sister she is your father s relative
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother s sister for she is your mother s relative
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father s brother that is you shall not approach his wife she is your aunt
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter in law she is your son s wife you shall not uncover her nakedness
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother s wife it is your brother s nakedness
You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and of her daughter and you shall not take her son s daughter or her daughter s daughter to uncover her nakedness they are relatives it is depravity
And you shall not take a woman as a rival wife to her sister uncovering her nakedness while her sister is still alive
You shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness while she is in her menstrual uncleanness
And you shall not lie sexually with your neighbor s wife and so make yourself unclean with her
You shall not give any of your children to offer them to Molech and so profane the name of your God I am the LORD
You shall not lie with a male as with a woman it is an abomination
And you shall not lie with any animal and so make yourself unclean with it neither shall any woman give herself to an animal to lie with it it is perversion
Do not make yourselves unclean by any of these things for by all these the nations I am driving out before you have become unclean
and the land became unclean so that I punished its iniquity and the land vomited out its inhabitants
But you shall keep my statutes and my rules and do none of these abominations either the native or the stranger who sojourns among you
for the people of the land who were before you did all of these abominations so that the land became unclean
lest the land vomit you out when you make it unclean as it vomited out the nation that was before you
For everyone who does any of these abominations the persons who do them shall be cut off from among their people
So keep my charge never to practice any of these abominable customs that were practiced before you and never to make yourselves unclean by them I am the LORD your God
