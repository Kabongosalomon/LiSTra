2 Chronicles 25
Amaziah was twenty five years old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty nine years in Jerusalem His mother s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem
And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD yet not with a whole heart
And as soon as the royal power was firmly his he killed his servants who had struck down the king his father
But he did not put their children to death according to what is written in the Law in the Book of Moses where the LORD commanded Fathers shall not die because of their children nor children die because of their fathers but each one shall die for his own sin
Then Amaziah assembled the men of Judah and set them by fathers houses under commanders of thousands and of hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin He mustered those twenty years old and upward and found that they were choice men fit for war able to handle spear and shield
He hired also mighty men of valor from Israel for talents of silver
But a man of God came to him and said O king do not let the army of Israel go with you for the LORD is not with Israel with all these Ephraimites
But go act be strong for the battle Why should you suppose that God will cast you down before the enemy For God has power to help or to cast down
And Amaziah said to the man of God But what shall we do about the hundred talents that I have given to the army of Israel The man of God answered The LORD is able to give you much more than this
Then Amaziah discharged the army that had come to him from Ephraim to go home again And they became very angry with Judah and returned home in fierce anger
But Amaziah took courage and led out his people and went to the Valley of Salt and struck down men of Seir
The men of Judah captured another alive and took them to the top of a rock and threw them down from the top of the rock and they were all dashed to pieces
But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back not letting them go with him to battle raided the cities of Judah from Samaria to Beth horon and struck down people in them and took much spoil
After Amaziah came from striking down the Edomites he brought the gods of the men of Seir and set them up as his gods and worshiped them making offerings to them
Therefore the LORD was angry with Amaziah and sent to him a prophet who said to him Why have you sought the gods of a people who did not deliver their own people from your hand
But as he was speaking the king said to him Have we made you a royal counselor Stop Why should you be struck down So the prophet stopped but said I know that God has determined to destroy you because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel
Then Amaziah king of Judah took counsel and sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu king of Israel saying Come let us look one another in the face
And Joash the king of Israel sent word to Amaziah king of Judah A thistle on Lebanon sent to a cedar on Lebanon saying Give your daughter to my son for a wife and a wild beast of Lebanon passed by and trampled down the thistle
You say See I have struck down Edom and your heart has lifted you up in boastfulness But now stay at home Why should you provoke trouble so that you fall you and Judah with you
But Amaziah would not listen for it was of God in order that he might give them into the hand of their enemies because they had sought the gods of Edom
So Joash king of Israel went up and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced one another in battle at Beth shemesh which belongs to Judah
And Judah was defeated by Israel and every man fled to his home
And Joash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah the son of Joash son of Ahaziah at Beth shemesh and brought him to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem for cubits from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate
And he seized all the gold and silver and all the vessels that were found in the house of God in the care of Obed edom He seized also the treasuries of the king s house also hostages and he returned to Samaria
Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived fifteen years after the death of Joash the son of Jehoahaz king of Israel
Now the rest of the deeds of Amaziah from first to last are they not written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel
From the time when he turned away from the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem and he fled to Lachish But they sent after him to Lachish and put him to death there
And they brought him upon horses and he was buried with his fathers in the city of David
