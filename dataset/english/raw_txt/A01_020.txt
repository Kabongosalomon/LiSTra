Genesis 20
From there Abraham journeyed toward the territory of the Negeb and lived between Kadesh and Shur and he sojourned in Gerar
And Abraham said of Sarah his wife She is my sister And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah
But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him Behold you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken for she is a man s wife
Now Abimelech had not approached her So he said Lord will you kill an innocent people
Did he not himself say to me She is my sister And she herself said He is my brother In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this
Then God said to him in the dream Yes I know that you have done this in the integrity of your heart and it was I who kept you from sinning against me Therefore I did not let you touch her
Now then return the man s wife for he is a prophet so that he will pray for you and you shall live But if you do not return her know that you shall surely die you and all who are yours
So Abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told them all these things And the men were very much afraid
Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him What have you done to us And how have I sinned against you that you have brought on me and my kingdom a great sin You have done to me things that ought not to be done
And Abimelech said to Abraham What did you see that you did this thing
Abraham said I did it because I thought There is no fear of God at all in this place and they will kill me because of my wife
Besides she is indeed my sister the daughter of my father though not the daughter of my mother and she became my wife
And when God caused me to wander from my father s house I said to her This is the kindness you must do me at every place to which we come say of me He is my brother
Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen and male servants and female servants and gave them to Abraham and returned Sarah his wife to him
And Abimelech said Behold my land is before you dwell where it pleases you
To Sarah he said Behold I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver It is a sign of your innocence in the eyes of all who are with you and before everyone you are vindicated
Then Abraham prayed to God and God healed Abimelech and also healed his wife and female slaves so that they bore children
For the LORD had closed all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah Abraham s wife
