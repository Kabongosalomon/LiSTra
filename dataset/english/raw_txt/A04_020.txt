Numbers 20
And the people of Israel the whole congregation came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month and the people stayed in Kadesh And Miriam died there and was buried there
Now there was no water for the congregation And they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron
And the people quarreled with Moses and said Would that we had perished when our brothers perished before the LORD
Why have you brought the assembly of the LORD into this wilderness that we should die here both we and our cattle
And why have you made us come up out of Egypt to bring us to this evil place It is no place for grain or figs or vines or pomegranates and there is no water to drink
Then Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the entrance of the tent of meeting and fell on their faces And the glory of the LORD appeared to them
and the LORD spoke to Moses saying
Take the staff and assemble the congregation you and Aaron your brother and tell the rock before their eyes to yield its water So you shall bring water out of the rock for them and give drink to the congregation and their cattle
And Moses took the staff from before the LORD as he commanded him
Then Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock and he said to them Hear now you rebels shall we bring water for you out of this rock
And Moses lifted up his hand and struck the rock with his staff twice and water came out abundantly and the congregation drank and their livestock
And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron Because you did not believe in me to uphold me as holy in the eyes of the people of Israel therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land that I have given them
These are the waters of Meribah where the people of Israel quarreled with the LORD and through them he showed himself holy
Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom Thus says your brother Israel You know all the hardship that we have met
how our fathers went down to Egypt and we lived in Egypt a long time And the Egyptians dealt harshly with us and our fathers
And when we cried to the LORD he heard our voice and sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt And here we are in Kadesh a city on the edge of your territory
Please let us pass through your land We will not pass through field or vineyard or drink water from a well We will go along the King s Highway We will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left until we have passed through your territory
But Edom said to him You shall not pass through lest I come out with the sword against you
And the people of Israel said to him We will go up by the highway and if we drink of your water I and my livestock then I will pay for it Let me only pass through on foot nothing more
But he said You shall not pass through And Edom came out against them with a large army and with a strong force
Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his territory so Israel turned away from him
And they journeyed from Kadesh and the people of Israel the whole congregation came to Mount Hor
And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron at Mount Hor on the border of the land of Edom
Let Aaron be gathered to his people for he shall not enter the land that I have given to the people of Israel because you rebelled against my command at the waters of Meribah
Take Aaron and Eleazar his son and bring them up to Mount Hor
And strip Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son And Aaron shall be gathered to his people and shall die there
Moses did as the LORD commanded And they went up Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation
And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son And Aaron died there on the top of the mountain Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain
And when all the congregation saw that Aaron had perished all the house of Israel wept for Aaron thirty days
