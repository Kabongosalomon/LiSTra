Matthew 21
Now when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage to the Mount of Olives then Jesus sent two disciples
saying to them Go into the village in front of you and immediately you will find a donkey tied and a colt with her Untie them and bring them to me
If anyone says anything to you you shall say The Lord needs them and he will send them at once
This took place to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet saying
Say to the daughter of Zion Behold your king is coming to you humble and mounted on a donkey and on a colt the foal of a beast of burden
The disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them
They brought the donkey and the colt and put on them their cloaks and he sat on them
Most of the crowd spread their cloaks on the road and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road
And the crowds that went before him and that followed him were shouting Hosanna to the Son of David Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord Hosanna in the highest
And when he entered Jerusalem the whole city was stirred up saying Who is this
And the crowds said This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth of Galilee
And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons
He said to them It is written My house shall be called a house of prayer but you make it a den of robbers
And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he healed them
But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did and the children crying out in the temple Hosanna to the Son of David they were indignant
and they said to him Do you hear what these are saying And Jesus said to them Yes have you never read Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise
And leaving them he went out of the city to Bethany and lodged there
In the morning as he was returning to the city he became hungry
And seeing a fig tree by the wayside he went to it and found nothing on it but only leaves And he said to it May no fruit ever come from you again And the fig tree withered at once
When the disciples saw it they marveled saying How did the fig tree wither at once
And Jesus answered them Truly I say to you if you have faith and do not doubt you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree but even if you say to this mountain Be taken up and thrown into the sea it will happen
And whatever you ask in prayer you will receive if you have faith
And when he entered the temple the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching and said By what authority are you doing these things and who gave you this authority
Jesus answered them I also will ask you one question and if you tell me the answer then I also will tell you by what authority I do these things
The baptism of John from where did it come From heaven or from man And they discussed it among themselves saying If we say From heaven he will say to us Why then did you not believe him
But if we say From man we are afraid of the crowd for they all hold that John was a prophet
So they answered Jesus We do not know And he said to them Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things
What do you think A man had two sons And he went to the first and said Son go and work in the vineyard today
And he answered I will not but afterward he changed his mind and went
And he went to the other son and said the same And he answered I go sir but did not go
Which of the two did the will of his father They said The first Jesus said to them Truly I say to you the tax collectors and the prostitutes go into the kingdom of God before you
For John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him And even when you saw it you did not afterward change your minds and believe him
Hear another parable There was a master of a house who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a winepress in it and built a tower and leased it to tenants and went into another country
When the season for fruit drew near he sent his servants to the tenants to get his fruit
And the tenants took his servants and beat one killed another and stoned another
Again he sent other servants more than the first And they did the same to them
Finally he sent his son to them saying They will respect my son
But when the tenants saw the son they said to themselves This is the heir Come let us kill him and have his inheritance
And they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him
When therefore the owner of the vineyard comes what will he do to those tenants
They said to him He will put those wretches to a miserable death and let out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the fruits in their seasons
Jesus said to them Have you never read in the Scriptures The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone this was the Lord s doing and it is marvelous in our eyes
Therefore I tell you the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people producing its fruits
And the one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces and when it falls on anyone it will crush him
When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables they perceived that he was speaking about them
And although they were seeking to arrest him they feared the crowds because they held him to be a prophet
