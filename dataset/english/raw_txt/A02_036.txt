Exodus 36
Bezalel and Oholiab and every craftsman in whom the LORD has put skill and intelligence to know how to do any work in the construction of the sanctuary shall work in accordance with all that the LORD has commanded
And Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab and every craftsman in whose mind the LORD had put skill everyone whose heart stirred him up to come to do the work
And they received from Moses all the contribution that the people of Israel had brought for doing the work on the sanctuary They still kept bringing him freewill offerings every morning
so that all the craftsmen who were doing every sort of task on the sanctuary came each from the task that he was doing
and said to Moses The people bring much more than enough for doing the work that the LORD has commanded us to do
So Moses gave command and word was proclaimed throughout the camp Let no man or woman do anything more for the contribution for the sanctuary So the people were restrained from bringing
for the material they had was sufficient to do all the work and more
And all the craftsmen among the workmen made the tabernacle with ten curtains They were made of fine twined linen and blue and purple and scarlet yarns with cherubim skillfully worked
The length of each curtain was twenty eight cubits and the breadth of each curtain four cubits All the curtains were the same size
He coupled five curtains to one another and the other five curtains he coupled to one another
He made loops of blue on the edge of the outermost curtain of the first set Likewise he made them on the edge of the outermost curtain of the second set
He made fifty loops on the one curtain and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was in the second set The loops were opposite one another
And he made fifty clasps of gold and coupled the curtains one to the other with clasps So the tabernacle was a single whole
He also made curtains of goats hair for a tent over the tabernacle He made eleven curtains
The length of each curtain was thirty cubits and the breadth of each curtain four cubits The eleven curtains were the same size
He coupled five curtains by themselves and six curtains by themselves
And he made fifty loops on the edge of the outermost curtain of the one set and fifty loops on the edge of the other connecting curtain
And he made fifty clasps of bronze to couple the tent together that it might be a single whole
And he made for the tent a covering of tanned rams skins and goatskins
Then he made the upright frames for the tabernacle of acacia wood
Ten cubits was the length of a frame and a cubit and a half the breadth of each frame
Each frame had two tenons for fitting together He did this for all the frames of the tabernacle
The frames for the tabernacle he made thus twenty frames for the south side
And he made forty bases of silver under the twenty frames two bases under one frame for its two tenons and two bases under the next frame for its two tenons
For the second side of the tabernacle on the north side he made twenty frames
and their forty bases of silver two bases under one frame and two bases under the next frame
For the rear of the tabernacle westward he made six frames
He made two frames for corners of the tabernacle in the rear
And they were separate beneath but joined at the top at the first ring He made two of them this way for the two corners
There were eight frames with their bases of silver sixteen bases under every frame two bases
He made bars of acacia wood five for the frames of the one side of the tabernacle
and five bars for the frames of the other side of the tabernacle and five bars for the frames of the tabernacle at the rear westward
And he made the middle bar to run from end to end halfway up the frames
And he overlaid the frames with gold and made their rings of gold for holders for the bars and overlaid the bars with gold
He made the veil of blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twined linen with cherubim skillfully worked into it he made it
And for it he made four pillars of acacia and overlaid them with gold Their hooks were of gold and he cast for them four bases of silver
He also made a screen for the entrance of the tent of blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twined linen embroidered with needlework
and its five pillars with their hooks He overlaid their capitals and their fillets were of gold but their five bases were of bronze
