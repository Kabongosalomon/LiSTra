2 Chronicles 17
Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place and strengthened himself against Israel
He placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah and set garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim that Asa his father had captured
The LORD was with Jehoshaphat because he walked in the earlier ways of his father David He did not seek the Baals
but sought the God of his father and walked in his commandments and not according to the practices of Israel
Therefore the LORD established the kingdom in his hand And all Judah brought tribute to Jehoshaphat and he had great riches and honor
His heart was courageous in the ways of the LORD And furthermore he took the high places and the Asherim out of Judah
In the third year of his reign he sent his officials Ben hail Obadiah Zechariah Nethanel and Micaiah to teach in the cities of Judah
and with them the Levites Shemaiah Nethaniah Zebadiah Asahel Shemiramoth Jehonathan Adonijah Tobijah and Tobadonijah and with these Levites the priests Elishama and Jehoram
And they taught in Judah having the Book of the Law of the LORD with them They went about through all the cities of Judah and taught among the people
And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah and they made no war against Jehoshaphat
Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents and silver for tribute and the Arabians also brought him rams and goats
And Jehoshaphat grew steadily greater He built in Judah fortresses and store cities
and he had large supplies in the cities of Judah He had soldiers mighty men of valor in Jerusalem
This was the muster of them by fathers houses Of Judah the commanders of thousands Adnah the commander with mighty men of valor
and next to him Jehohanan the commander with
and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri a volunteer for the service of the LORD with mighty men of valor
Of Benjamin Eliada a mighty man of valor with men armed with bow and shield
and next to him Jehozabad with armed for war
