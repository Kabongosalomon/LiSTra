Proverbs 16
The plans of the heart belong to man but the answer of the tongue is from the LORD
All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes but the LORD weighs the spirit
Commit your work to the LORD and your plans will be established
The LORD has made everything for its purpose even the wicked for the day of trouble
Everyone who is arrogant in heart is an abomination to the LORD be assured he will not go unpunished
By steadfast love and faithfulness iniquity is atoned for and by the fear of the LORD one turns away from evil
When a man s ways please the LORD he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him
Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues with injustice
The heart of man plans his way but the LORD establishes his steps
An oracle is on the lips of a king his mouth does not sin in judgment
A just balance and scales are the LORD s all the weights in the bag are his work
It is an abomination to kings to do evil for the throne is established by righteousness
Righteous lips are the delight of a king and he loves him who speaks what is right
A king s wrath is a messenger of death and a wise man will appease it
In the light of a king s face there is life and his favor is like the clouds that bring the spring rain
How much better to get wisdom than gold To get understanding is to be chosen rather than silver
The highway of the upright turns aside from evil whoever guards his way preserves his life
Pride goes before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall
It is better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor than to divide the spoil with the proud
Whoever gives thought to the word will discover good and blessed is he who trusts in the LORD
The wise of heart is called discerning and sweetness of speech increases persuasiveness
Good sense is a fountain of life to him who has it but the instruction of fools is folly
The heart of the wise makes his speech judicious and adds persuasiveness to his lips
Gracious words are like a honeycomb sweetness to the soul and health to the body
There is a way that seems right to a man but its end is the way to death
A worker s appetite works for him his mouth urges him on
A worthless man plots evil and his speech is like a scorching fire
A dishonest man spreads strife and a whisperer separates close friends
A man of violence entices his neighbor and leads him in a way that is not good
Whoever winks his eyes plans dishonest things he who purses his lips brings evil to pass
Gray hair is a crown of glory it is gained in a righteous life
Whoever is slow to anger is better than the mighty and he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city
The lot is cast into the lap but its every decision is from the LORD
