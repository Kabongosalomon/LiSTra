Luke 2
In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered
This was the first registration when Quirinius was governor of Syria
And all went to be registered each to his own town
And Joseph also went up from Galilee from the town of Nazareth to Judea to the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of David
to be registered with Mary his betrothed who was with child
And while they were there the time came for her to give birth
And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger because there was no place for them in the inn
And in the same region there were shepherds out in the field keeping watch over their flock by night
And an angel of the Lord appeared to them and the glory of the Lord shone around them and they were filled with fear
And the angel said to them Fear not for behold I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people
For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior who is Christ the Lord
And this will be a sign for you you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger
And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying
Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased
When the angels went away from them into heaven the shepherds said to one another Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened which the Lord has made known to us
And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph and the baby lying in a manger
And when they saw it they made known the saying that had been told them concerning this child
And all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them
But Mary treasured up all these things pondering them in her heart
And the shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen as it had been told them
And at the end of eight days when he was circumcised he was called Jesus the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb
And when the time came for their purification according to the Law of Moses they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord
as it is written in the Law of the Lord Every male who first opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord
and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the Law of the Lord a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons
Now there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and this man was righteous and devout waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Spirit was upon him
And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord s Christ
And he came in the Spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him according to the custom of the Law
he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said
Lord now you are letting your servant depart in peace according to your word
for my eyes have seen your salvation
that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples
a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your people Israel
And his father and his mother marveled at what was said about him
And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother Behold this child is appointed for the fall and rising of many in Israel and for a sign that is opposed
and a sword will pierce through your own soul also so that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed
And there was a prophetess Anna the daughter of Phanuel of the tribe of Asher She was advanced in years having lived with her husband seven years from when she was a virgin
and then as a widow until she was eighty four She did not depart from the temple worshiping with fasting and prayer night and day
And coming up at that very hour she began to give thanks to God and to speak of him to all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem
And when they had performed everything according to the Law of the Lord they returned into Galilee to their own town of Nazareth
And the child grew and became strong filled with wisdom And the favor of God was upon him
Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover
And when he was twelve years old they went up according to custom
And when the feast was ended as they were returning the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem His parents did not know it
but supposing him to be in the group they went a day s journey but then they began to search for him among their relatives and acquaintances
and when they did not find him they returned to Jerusalem searching for him
After three days they found him in the temple sitting among the teachers listening to them and asking them questions
And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers
And when his parents saw him they were astonished And his mother said to him Son why have you treated us so Behold your father and I have been searching for you in great distress
And he said to them Why were you looking for me Did you not know that I must be in my Father s house
And they did not understand the saying that he spoke to them
And he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was submissive to them And his mother treasured up all these things in her heart
And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and man
