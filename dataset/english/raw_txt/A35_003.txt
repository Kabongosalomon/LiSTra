Habakkuk 3
A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet according to Shigionoth
O LORD I have heard the report of you and your work O LORD do I fear In the midst of the years revive it in the midst of the years make it known in wrath remember mercy
God came from Teman and the Holy One from Mount Paran His splendor covered the heavens and the earth was full of his praise Selah
His brightness was like the light rays flashed from his hand and there he veiled his power
Before him went pestilence and plague followed at his heels
He stood and measured the earth he looked and shook the nations then the eternal mountains were scattered the everlasting hills sank low His were the everlasting ways
I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble
Was your wrath against the rivers O LORD Was your anger against the rivers or your indignation against the sea when you rode on your horses on your chariot of salvation
You stripped the sheath from your bow calling for many arrows Selah You split the earth with rivers
The mountains saw you and writhed the raging waters swept on the deep gave forth its voice it lifted its hands on high
The sun and moon stood still in their place at the light of your arrows as they sped at the flash of your glittering spear
You marched through the earth in fury you threshed the nations in anger
You went out for the salvation of your people for the salvation of your anointed You crushed the head of the house of the wicked laying him bare from thigh to neck Selah
You pierced with his own arrows the heads of his warriors who came like a whirlwind to scatter me rejoicing as if to devour the poor in secret
You trampled the sea with your horses the surging of mighty waters
I hear and my body trembles my lips quiver at the sound rottenness enters into my bones my legs tremble beneath me Yet I will quietly wait for the day of trouble to come upon people who invade us
Though the fig tree should not blossom nor fruit be on the vines the produce of the olive fail and the fields yield no food the flock be cut off from the fold and there be no herd in the stalls
yet I will rejoice in the LORD I will take joy in the God of my salvation
GOD the Lord is my strength he makes my feet like the deer s he makes me tread on my high places To the choirmaster with stringed instruments
