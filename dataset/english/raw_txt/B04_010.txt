John 10
Truly truly I say to you he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in by another way that man is a thief and a robber
But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep
To him the gatekeeper opens The sheep hear his voice and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out
When he has brought out all his own he goes before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice
A stranger they will not follow but they will flee from him for they do not know the voice of strangers
This figure of speech Jesus used with them but they did not understand what he was saying to them
So Jesus again said to them Truly truly I say to you I am the door of the sheep
All who came before me are thieves and robbers but the sheep did not listen to them
I am the door If anyone enters by me he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture
The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy I came that they may have life and have it abundantly
I am the good shepherd The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep
He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd who does not own the sheep sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees and the wolf snatches them and scatters them
He flees because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep
I am the good shepherd I know my own and my own know me
just as the Father knows me and I know the Father and I lay down my life for the sheep
And I have other sheep that are not of this fold I must bring them also and they will listen to my voice So there will be one flock one shepherd
For this reason the Father loves me because I lay down my life that I may take it up again
No one takes it from me but I lay it down of my own accord I have authority to lay it down and I have authority to take it up again This charge I have received from my Father
There was again a division among the Jews because of these words
Many of them said He has a demon and is insane why listen to him
Others said These are not the words of one who is oppressed by a demon Can a demon open the eyes of the blind
At that time the Feast of Dedication took place at Jerusalem It was winter
and Jesus was walking in the temple in the colonnade of Solomon
So the Jews gathered around him and said to him How long will you keep us in suspense If you are the Christ tell us plainly
Jesus answered them I told you and you do not believe The works that I do in my Father s name bear witness about me
but you do not believe because you are not part of my flock
My sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me
I give them eternal life and they will never perish and no one will snatch them out of my hand
My Father who has given them to me is greater than all and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father s hand
I and the Father are one
The Jews picked up stones again to stone him
Jesus answered them I have shown you many good works from the Father for which of them are you going to stone me
The Jews answered him It is not for a good work that we are going to stone you but for blasphemy because you being a man make yourself God
Jesus answered them Is it not written in your Law I said you are gods
If he called them gods to whom the word of God came and Scripture cannot be broken
do you say of him whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world You are blaspheming because I said I am the Son of God
If I am not doing the works of my Father then do not believe me
but if I do them even though you do not believe me believe the works that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father
Again they sought to arrest him but he escaped from their hands
He went away again across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing at first and there he remained
And many came to him And they said John did no sign but everything that John said about this man was true
And many believed in him there
