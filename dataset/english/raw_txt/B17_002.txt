Titus 2
But as for you teach what accords with sound doctrine
Older men are to be sober minded dignified self controlled sound in faith in love and in steadfastness
Older women likewise are to be reverent in behavior not slanderers or slaves to much wine They are to teach what is good
and so train the young women to love their husbands and children
to be self controlled pure working at home kind and submissive to their own husbands that the word of God may not be reviled
Likewise urge the younger men to be self controlled
Show yourself in all respects to be a model of good works and in your teaching show integrity dignity
and sound speech that cannot be condemned so that an opponent may be put to shame having nothing evil to say about us
Slaves are to be submissive to their own masters in everything they are to be well pleasing not argumentative
not pilfering but showing all good faith so that in everything they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior
For the grace of God has appeared bringing salvation for all people
training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions and to live self controlled upright and godly lives in the present age
waiting for our blessed hope the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ
who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for good works
Declare these things exhort and rebuke with all authority Let no one disregard you
