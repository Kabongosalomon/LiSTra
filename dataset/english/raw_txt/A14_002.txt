2 Chronicles 2
Now Solomon purposed to build a temple for the name of the LORD and a royal palace for himself
And Solomon assigned men to bear burdens and to quarry in the hill country and to oversee them
And Solomon sent word to Hiram the king of Tyre As you dealt with David my father and sent him cedar to build himself a house to dwell in so deal with me
Behold I am about to build a house for the name of the LORD my God and dedicate it to him for the burning of incense of sweet spices before him and for the regular arrangement of the showbread and for burnt offerings morning and evening on the Sabbaths and the new moons and the appointed feasts of the LORD our God as ordained forever for Israel
The house that I am to build will be great for our God is greater than all gods
But who is able to build him a house since heaven even highest heaven cannot contain him Who am I to build a house for him except as a place to make offerings before him
So now send me a man skilled to work in gold silver bronze and iron and in purple crimson and blue fabrics trained also in engraving to be with the skilled workers who are with me in Judah and Jerusalem whom David my father provided
Send me also cedar cypress and algum timber from Lebanon for I know that your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon And my servants will be with your servants
to prepare timber for me in abundance for the house I am to build will be great and wonderful
I will give for your servants the woodsmen who cut timber cors of crushed wheat cors of barley baths of wine and baths of oil
Then Hiram the king of Tyre answered in a letter that he sent to Solomon Because the LORD loves his people he has made you king over them
Hiram also said Blessed be the LORD God of Israel who made heaven and earth who has given King David a wise son who has discretion and understanding who will build a temple for the LORD and a royal palace for himself
Now I have sent a skilled man who has understanding Huram abi
the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan and his father was a man of Tyre He is trained to work in gold silver bronze iron stone and wood and in purple blue and crimson fabrics and fine linen and to do all sorts of engraving and execute any design that may be assigned him with your craftsmen the craftsmen of my lord David your father
Now therefore the wheat and barley oil and wine of which my lord has spoken let him send to his servants
And we will cut whatever timber you need from Lebanon and bring it to you in rafts by sea to Joppa so that you may take it up to Jerusalem
Then Solomon counted all the resident aliens who were in the land of Israel after the census of them that David his father had taken and there were found
Seventy thousand of them he assigned to bear burdens to quarry in the hill country and as overseers to make the people work
