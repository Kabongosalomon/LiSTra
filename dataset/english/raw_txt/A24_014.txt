Jeremiah 14
The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought
Judah mourns and her gates languish her people lament on the ground and the cry of Jerusalem goes up
Her nobles send their servants for water they come to the cisterns they find no water they return with their vessels empty they are ashamed and confounded and cover their heads
Because of the ground that is dismayed since there is no rain on the land the farmers are ashamed they cover their heads
Even the doe in the field forsakes her newborn fawn because there is no grass
The wild donkeys stand on the bare heights they pant for air like jackals their eyes fail because there is no vegetation
Though our iniquities testify against us act O LORD for your name s sake for our backslidings are many we have sinned against you
O you hope of Israel its savior in time of trouble why should you be like a stranger in the land like a traveler who turns aside to tarry for a night
Why should you be like a man confused like a mighty warrior who cannot save Yet you O LORD are in the midst of us and we are called by your name do not leave us
Thus says the LORD concerning this people They have loved to wander thus they have not restrained their feet therefore the LORD does not accept them now he will remember their iniquity and punish their sins
The LORD said to me Do not pray for the welfare of this people
Though they fast I will not hear their cry and though they offer burnt offering and grain offering I will not accept them But I will consume them by the sword by famine and by pestilence
Then I said Ah Lord GOD behold the prophets say to them You shall not see the sword nor shall you have famine but I will give you assured peace in this place
And the LORD said to me The prophets are prophesying lies in my name I did not send them nor did I command them or speak to them They are prophesying to you a lying vision worthless divination and the deceit of their own minds
Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who prophesy in my name although I did not send them and who say Sword and famine shall not come upon this land By sword and famine those prophets shall be consumed
And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem victims of famine and sword with none to bury them them their wives their sons and their daughters For I will pour out their evil upon them
You shall say to them this word Let my eyes run down with tears night and day and let them not cease for the virgin daughter of my people is shattered with a great wound with a very grievous blow
If I go out into the field behold those pierced by the sword And if I enter the city behold the diseases of famine For both prophet and priest ply their trade through the land and have no knowledge
Have you utterly rejected Judah Does your soul loathe Zion Why have you struck us down so that there is no healing for us We looked for peace but no good came for a time of healing but behold terror
We acknowledge our wickedness O LORD and the iniquity of our fathers for we have sinned against you
Do not spurn us for your name s sake do not dishonor your glorious throne remember and do not break your covenant with us
Are there any among the false gods of the nations that can bring rain Or can the heavens give showers Are you not he O LORD our God We set our hope on you for you do all these things
