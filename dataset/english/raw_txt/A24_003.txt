Jeremiah 3
If a man divorces his wife and she goes from him and becomes another man s wife will he return to her Would not that land be greatly polluted You have played the whore with many lovers and would you return to me declares the LORD
Lift up your eyes to the bare heights and see Where have you not been ravished By the waysides you have sat awaiting lovers like an Arab in the wilderness You have polluted the land with your vile whoredom
Therefore the showers have been withheld and the spring rain has not come yet you have the forehead of a whore you refuse to be ashamed
Have you not just now called to me My father you are the friend of my youth
will he be angry forever will he be indignant to the end Behold you have spoken but you have done all the evil that you could
The LORD said to me in the days of King Josiah Have you seen what she did that faithless one Israel how she went up on every high hill and under every green tree and there played the whore
And I thought After she has done all this she will return to me but she did not return and her treacherous sister Judah saw it
She saw that for all the adulteries of that faithless one Israel I had sent her away with a decree of divorce Yet her treacherous sister Judah did not fear but she too went and played the whore
Because she took her whoredom lightly she polluted the land committing adultery with stone and tree
Yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah did not return to me with her whole heart but in pretense declares the LORD
And the LORD said to me Faithless Israel has shown herself more righteous than treacherous Judah
Go and proclaim these words toward the north and say Return faithless Israel declares the LORD I will not look on you in anger for I am merciful declares the LORD I will not be angry forever
Only acknowledge your guilt that you rebelled against the LORD your God and scattered your favors among foreigners under every green tree and that you have not obeyed my voice declares the LORD
Return O faithless children declares the LORD for I am your master I will take you one from a city and two from a family and I will bring you to Zion
And I will give you shepherds after my own heart who will feed you with knowledge and understanding
And when you have multiplied and increased in the land in those days declares the LORD they shall no more say The ark of the covenant of the LORD It shall not come to mind or be remembered or missed it shall not be made again
At that time Jerusalem shall be called the throne of the LORD and all nations shall gather to it to the presence of the LORD in Jerusalem and they shall no more stubbornly follow their own evil heart
In those days the house of Judah shall join the house of Israel and together they shall come from the land of the north to the land that I gave your fathers for a heritage
I said How I would set you among my sons and give you a pleasant land a heritage most beautiful of all nations And I thought you would call me My Father and would not turn from following me
Surely as a treacherous wife leaves her husband so have you been treacherous to me O house of Israel declares the LORD
A voice on the bare heights is heard the weeping and pleading of Israel s sons because they have perverted their way they have forgotten the LORD their God
Return O faithless sons I will heal your faithlessness Behold we come to you for you are the LORD our God
Truly the hills are a delusion the orgies on the mountains Truly in the LORD our God is the salvation of Israel
But from our youth the shameful thing has devoured all for which our fathers labored their flocks and their herds their sons and their daughters
Let us lie down in our shame and let our dishonor cover us For we have sinned against the LORD our God we and our fathers from our youth even to this day and we have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God
