1 Chronicles 22
Then David said Here shall be the house of the LORD God and here the altar of burnt offering for Israel
David commanded to gather together the resident aliens who were in the land of Israel and he set stonecutters to prepare dressed stones for building the house of God
David also provided great quantities of iron for nails for the doors of the gates and for clamps as well as bronze in quantities beyond weighing
and cedar timbers without number for the Sidonians and Tyrians brought great quantities of cedar to David
For David said Solomon my son is young and inexperienced and the house that is to be built for the LORD must be exceedingly magnificent of fame and glory throughout all lands I will therefore make preparation for it So David provided materials in great quantity before his death
Then he called for Solomon his son and charged him to build a house for the LORD the God of Israel
David said to Solomon My son I had it in my heart to build a house to the name of the LORD my God
But the word of the LORD came to me saying You have shed much blood and have waged great wars You shall not build a house to my name because you have shed so much blood before me on the earth
Behold a son shall be born to you who shall be a man of rest I will give him rest from all his surrounding enemies For his name shall be Solomon and I will give peace and quiet to Israel in his days
He shall build a house for my name He shall be my son and I will be his father and I will establish his royal throne in Israel forever
Now my son the LORD be with you so that you may succeed in building the house of the LORD your God as he has spoken concerning you
Only may the LORD grant you discretion and understanding that when he gives you charge over Israel you may keep the law of the LORD your God
Then you will prosper if you are careful to observe the statutes and the rules that the LORD commanded Moses for Israel Be strong and courageous Fear not do not be dismayed
With great pains I have provided for the house of the LORD talents of gold a million talents of silver and bronze and iron beyond weighing for there is so much of it timber and stone too I have provided To these you must add
You have an abundance of workmen stonecutters masons carpenters and all kinds of craftsmen without number skilled in working
gold silver bronze and iron Arise and work The LORD be with you
David also commanded all the leaders of Israel to help Solomon his son saying
Is not the LORD your God with you And has he not given you peace on every side For he has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand and the land is subdued before the LORD and his people
Now set your mind and heart to seek the LORD your God Arise and build the sanctuary of the LORD God so that the ark of the covenant of the LORD and the holy vessels of God may be brought into a house built for the name of the LORD
