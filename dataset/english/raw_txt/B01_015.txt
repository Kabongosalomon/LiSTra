Matthew 15
Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said
Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders For they do not wash their hands when they eat
He answered them And why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition
For God commanded Honor your father and your mother and Whoever reviles father or mother must surely die
But you say If anyone tells his father or his mother What you would have gained from me is given to God
he need not honor his father So for the sake of your tradition you have made void the word of God
You hypocrites Well did Isaiah prophesy of you when he said
This people honors me with their lips but their heart is far from me
in vain do they worship me teaching as doctrines the commandments of men
And he called the people to him and said to them Hear and understand
it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person but what comes out of the mouth this defiles a person
Then the disciples came and said to him Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying
He answered Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up
Let them alone they are blind guides And if the blind lead the blind both will fall into a pit
But Peter said to him Explain the parable to us
And he said Are you also still without understanding
Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and is expelled
But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart and this defiles a person
For out of the heart come evil thoughts murder adultery sexual immorality theft false witness slander
These are what defile a person But to eat with unwashed hands does not defile anyone
And Jesus went away from there and withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon
And behold a Canaanite woman from that region came out and was crying Have mercy on me O Lord Son of David my daughter is severely oppressed by a demon
But he did not answer her a word And his disciples came and begged him saying Send her away for she is crying out after us
He answered I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel
But she came and knelt before him saying Lord help me
And he answered It is not right to take the children s bread and throw it to the dogs
She said Yes Lord yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters table
Then Jesus answered her O woman great is your faith Be it done for you as you desire And her daughter was healed instantly
Jesus went on from there and walked beside the Sea of Galilee And he went up on the mountain and sat down there
And great crowds came to him bringing with them the lame the blind the crippled the mute and many others and they put them at his feet and he healed them
so that the crowd wondered when they saw the mute speaking the crippled healthy the lame walking and the blind seeing And they glorified the God of Israel
Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said I have compassion on the crowd because they have been with me now three days and have nothing to eat And I am unwilling to send them away hungry lest they faint on the way
And the disciples said to him Where are we to get enough bread in such a desolate place to feed so great a crowd
And Jesus said to them How many loaves do you have They said Seven and a few small fish
And directing the crowd to sit down on the ground
he took the seven loaves and the fish and having given thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples and the disciples gave them to the crowds
And they all ate and were satisfied And they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces left over
Those who ate were four thousand men besides women and children
And after sending away the crowds he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan
