2 Samuel 14
Now Joab the son of Zeruiah knew that the king s heart went out to Absalom
And Joab sent to Tekoa and brought from there a wise woman and said to her Pretend to be a mourner and put on mourning garments Do not anoint yourself with oil but behave like a woman who has been mourning many days for the dead
Go to the king and speak thus to him So Joab put the words in her mouth
When the woman of Tekoa came to the king she fell on her face to the ground and paid homage and said Save me O king
And the king said to her What is your trouble She answered Alas I am a widow my husband is dead
And your servant had two sons and they quarreled with one another in the field There was no one to separate them and one struck the other and killed him
And now the whole clan has risen against your servant and they say Give up the man who struck his brother that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed And so they would destroy the heir also Thus they would quench my coal that is left and leave to my husband neither name nor remnant on the face of the earth
Then the king said to the woman Go to your house and I will give orders concerning you
And the woman of Tekoa said to the king On me be the guilt my lord the king and on my father s house let the king and his throne be guiltless
The king said If anyone says anything to you bring him to me and he shall never touch you again
Then she said Please let the king invoke the LORD your God that the avenger of blood kill no more and my son be not destroyed He said As the LORD lives not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground
Then the woman said Please let your servant speak a word to my lord the king He said Speak
And the woman said Why then have you planned such a thing against the people of God For in giving this decision the king convicts himself inasmuch as the king does not bring his banished one home again
We must all die we are like water spilled on the ground which cannot be gathered up again But God will not take away life and he devises means so that the banished one will not remain an outcast
Now I have come to say this to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid and your servant thought I will speak to the king it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant
For the king will hear and deliver his servant from the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together from the heritage of God
And your servant thought The word of my lord the king will set me at rest for my lord the king is like the angel of God to discern good and evil The LORD your God be with you
Then the king answered the woman Do not hide from me anything I ask you And the woman said Let my lord the king speak
The king said Is the hand of Joab with you in all this The woman answered and said As surely as you live my lord the king one cannot turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has said It was your servant Joab who commanded me it was he who put all these words in the mouth of your servant
In order to change the course of things your servant Joab did this But my lord has wisdom like the wisdom of the angel of God to know all things that are on the earth
Then the king said to Joab Behold now I grant this go bring back the young man Absalom
And Joab fell on his face to the ground and paid homage and blessed the king And Joab said Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight my lord the king in that the king has granted the request of his servant
So Joab arose and went to Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem
And the king said Let him dwell apart in his own house he is not to come into my presence So Absalom lived apart in his own house and did not come into the king s presence
Now in all Israel there was no one so much to be praised for his handsome appearance as Absalom From the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him
And when he cut the hair of his head for at the end of every year he used to cut it when it was heavy on him he cut it he weighed the hair of his head two hundred shekels by the king s weight
There were born to Absalom three sons and one daughter whose name was Tamar She was a beautiful woman
So Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem without coming into the king s presence
Then Absalom sent for Joab to send him to the king but Joab would not come to him And he sent a second time but Joab would not come
Then he said to his servants See Joab s field is next to mine and he has barley there go and set it on fire So Absalom s servants set the field on fire
Then Joab arose and went to Absalom at his house and said to him Why have your servants set my field on fire
Absalom answered Joab Behold I sent word to you Come here that I may send you to the king to ask Why have I come from Geshur It would be better for me to be there still Now therefore let me go into the presence of the king and if there is guilt in me let him put me to death
Then Joab went to the king and told him and he summoned Absalom So he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king and the king kissed Absalom
