Jeremiah 15
Then the LORD said to me Though Moses and Samuel stood before me yet my heart would not turn toward this people Send them out of my sight and let them go
And when they ask you Where shall we go you shall say to them Thus says the LORD Those who are for pestilence to pestilence and those who are for the sword to the sword those who are for famine to famine and those who are for captivity to captivity
I will appoint over them four kinds of destroyers declares the LORD the sword to kill the dogs to tear and the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy
And I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth because of what Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah did in Jerusalem
Who will have pity on you O Jerusalem or who will grieve for you Who will turn aside to ask about your welfare
You have rejected me declares the LORD you keep going backward so I have stretched out my hand against you and destroyed you I am weary of relenting
I have winnowed them with a winnowing fork in the gates of the land I have bereaved them I have destroyed my people they did not turn from their ways
I have made their widows more in number than the sand of the seas I have brought against the mothers of young men a destroyer at noonday I have made anguish and terror fall upon them suddenly
She who bore seven has grown feeble she has fainted away her sun went down while it was yet day she has been shamed and disgraced And the rest of them I will give to the sword before their enemies declares the LORD
Woe is me my mother that you bore me a man of strife and contention to the whole land I have not lent nor have I borrowed yet all of them curse me
The LORD said Have I not set you free for their good Have I not pleaded for you before the enemy in the time of trouble and in the time of distress
Can one break iron iron from the north and bronze
Your wealth and your treasures I will give as spoil without price for all your sins throughout all your territory
I will make you serve your enemies in a land that you do not know for in my anger a fire is kindled that shall burn forever
O LORD you know remember me and visit me and take vengeance for me on my persecutors In your forbearance take me not away know that for your sake I bear reproach
Your words were found and I ate them and your words became to me a joy and the delight of my heart for I am called by your name O LORD God of hosts
I did not sit in the company of revelers nor did I rejoice I sat alone because your hand was upon me for you had filled me with indignation
Why is my pain unceasing my wound incurable refusing to be healed Will you be to me like a deceitful brook like waters that fail
Therefore thus says the LORD If you return I will restore you and you shall stand before me If you utter what is precious and not what is worthless you shall be as my mouth They shall turn to you but you shall not turn to them
And I will make you to this people a fortified wall of bronze they will fight against you but they shall not prevail over you for I am with you to save you and deliver you declares the LORD
I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked and redeem you from the grasp of the ruthless
