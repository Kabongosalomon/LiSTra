John 19
Then Pilate took Jesus and flogged him
And the soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head and arrayed him in a purple robe
They came up to him saying Hail King of the Jews and struck him with their hands
Pilate went out again and said to them See I am bringing him out to you that you may know that I find no guilt in him
So Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe Pilate said to them Behold the man
When the chief priests and the officers saw him they cried out Crucify him crucify him Pilate said to them Take him yourselves and crucify him for I find no guilt in him
The Jews answered him We have a law and according to that law he ought to die because he has made himself the Son of God
When Pilate heard this statement he was even more afraid
He entered his headquarters again and said to Jesus Where are you from But Jesus gave him no answer
So Pilate said to him You will not speak to me Do you not know that I have authority to release you and authority to crucify you
Jesus answered him You would have no authority over me at all unless it had been given you from above Therefore he who delivered me over to you has the greater sin
From then on Pilate sought to release him but the Jews cried out If you release this man you are not Caesar s friend Everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar
So when Pilate heard these words he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Stone Pavement and in Aramaic Gabbatha
Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover It was about the sixth hour He said to the Jews Behold your King
They cried out Away with him away with him crucify him Pilate said to them Shall I crucify your King The chief priests answered We have no king but Caesar
So he delivered him over to them to be crucified So they took Jesus
and he went out bearing his own cross to the place called The Place of a Skull which in Aramaic is called Golgotha
There they crucified him and with him two others one on either side and Jesus between them
Pilate also wrote an inscription and put it on the cross It read Jesus of Nazareth the King of the Jews
Many of the Jews read this inscription for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city and it was written in Aramaic in Latin and in Greek
So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate Do not write The King of the Jews but rather This man said I am King of the Jews
Pilate answered What I have written I have written
When the soldiers had crucified Jesus they took his garments and divided them into four parts one part for each soldier also his tunic But the tunic was seamless woven in one piece from top to bottom
so they said to one another Let us not tear it but cast lots for it to see whose it shall be This was to fulfill the Scripture which says They divided my garments among them and for my clothing they cast lots So the soldiers did these things
but standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother s sister Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary Magdalene
When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby he said to his mother Woman behold your son
Then he said to the disciple Behold your mother And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home
After this Jesus knowing that all was now finished said to fulfill the Scripture I thirst
A jar full of sour wine stood there so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop branch and held it to his mouth
When Jesus had received the sour wine he said It is finished and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit
Since it was the day of Preparation and so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath for that Sabbath was a high day the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away
So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who had been crucified with him
But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead they did not break his legs
But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear and at once there came out blood and water
He who saw it has borne witness his testimony is true and he knows that he is telling the truth that you also may believe
For these things took place that the Scripture might be fulfilled Not one of his bones will be broken
And again another Scripture says They will look on him whom they have pierced
After these things Joseph of Arimathea who was a disciple of Jesus but secretly for fear of the Jews asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus and Pilate gave him permission So he came and took away his body
Nicodemus also who earlier had come to Jesus by night came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes about seventy five pounds in weight
So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices as is the burial custom of the Jews
Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid
So because of the Jewish day of Preparation since the tomb was close at hand they laid Jesus there
