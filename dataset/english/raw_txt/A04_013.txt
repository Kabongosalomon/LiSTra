Numbers 13
The LORD spoke to Moses saying
Send men to spy out the land of Canaan which I am giving to the people of Israel From each tribe of their fathers you shall send a man every one a chief among them
So Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to the command of the LORD all of them men who were heads of the people of Israel
And these were their names From the tribe of Reuben Shammua the son of Zaccur
from the tribe of Simeon Shaphat the son of Hori
from the tribe of Judah Caleb the son of Jephunneh
from the tribe of Issachar Igal the son of Joseph
from the tribe of Ephraim Hoshea the son of Nun
from the tribe of Benjamin Palti the son of Raphu
from the tribe of Zebulun Gaddiel the son of Sodi
from the tribe of Joseph that is from the tribe of Manasseh Gaddi the son of Susi
from the tribe of Dan Ammiel the son of Gemalli
from the tribe of Asher Sethur the son of Michael
from the tribe of Naphtali Nahbi the son of Vophsi
from the tribe of Gad Geuel the son of Machi
These were the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua
Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan and said to them Go up into the Negeb and go up into the hill country
and see what the land is and whether the people who dwell in it are strong or weak whether they are few or many
and whether the land that they dwell in is good or bad and whether the cities that they dwell in are camps or strongholds
and whether the land is rich or poor and whether there are trees in it or not Be of good courage and bring some of the fruit of the land Now the time was the season of the first ripe grapes
So they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob near Lebo hamath
They went up into the Negeb and came to Hebron Ahiman Sheshai and Talmai the descendants of Anak were there Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt
And they came to the Valley of Eshcol and cut down from there a branch with a single cluster of grapes and they carried it on a pole between two of them they also brought some pomegranates and figs
That place was called the Valley of Eshcol because of the cluster that the people of Israel cut down from there
At the end of forty days they returned from spying out the land
And they came to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation of the people of Israel in the wilderness of Paran at Kadesh They brought back word to them and to all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land
And they told him We came to the land to which you sent us It flows with milk and honey and this is its fruit
However the people who dwell in the land are strong and the cities are fortified and very large And besides we saw the descendants of Anak there
The Amalekites dwell in the land of the Negeb The Hittites the Jebusites and the Amorites dwell in the hill country And the Canaanites dwell by the sea and along the Jordan
But Caleb quieted the people before Moses and said Let us go up at once and occupy it for we are well able to overcome it
Then the men who had gone up with him said We are not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we are
So they brought to the people of Israel a bad report of the land that they had spied out saying The land through which we have gone to spy it out is a land that devours its inhabitants and all the people that we saw in it are of great height
And there we saw the Nephilim the sons of Anak who come from the Nephilim and we seemed to ourselves like grasshoppers and so we seemed to them
