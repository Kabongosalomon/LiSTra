Jeremiah 4
If you return O Israel declares the LORD to me you should return If you remove your detestable things from my presence and do not waver
and if you swear As the LORD lives in truth in justice and in righteousness then nations shall bless themselves in him and in him shall they glory
For thus says the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem Break up your fallow ground and sow not among thorns
Circumcise yourselves to the LORD remove the foreskin of your hearts O men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem lest my wrath go forth like fire and burn with none to quench it because of the evil of your deeds
Declare in Judah and proclaim in Jerusalem and say Blow the trumpet through the land cry aloud and say Assemble and let us go into the fortified cities
Raise a standard toward Zion flee for safety stay not for I bring disaster from the north and great destruction
A lion has gone up from his thicket a destroyer of nations has set out he has gone out from his place to make your land a waste your cities will be ruins without inhabitant
For this put on sackcloth lament and wail for the fierce anger of the LORD has not turned back from us
In that day declares the LORD courage shall fail both king and officials The priests shall be appalled and the prophets astounded
Then I said Ah Lord GOD surely you have utterly deceived this people and Jerusalem saying It shall be well with you whereas the sword has reached their very life
At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem A hot wind from the bare heights in the desert toward the daughter of my people not to winnow or cleanse
a wind too full for this comes for me Now it is I who speak in judgment upon them
Behold he comes up like clouds his chariots like the whirlwind his horses are swifter than eagles woe to us for we are ruined
O Jerusalem wash your heart from evil that you may be saved How long shall your wicked thoughts lodge within you
For a voice declares from Dan and proclaims trouble from Mount Ephraim
Warn the nations that he is coming announce to Jerusalem Besiegers come from a distant land they shout against the cities of Judah
Like keepers of a field are they against her all around because she has rebelled against me declares the LORD
Your ways and your deeds have brought this upon you This is your doom and it is bitter it has reached your very heart
My anguish my anguish I writhe in pain Oh the walls of my heart My heart is beating wildly I cannot keep silent for I hear the sound of the trumpet the alarm of war
Crash follows hard on crash the whole land is laid waste Suddenly my tents are laid waste my curtains in a moment
How long must I see the standard and hear the sound of the trumpet
For my people are foolish they know me not they are stupid children they have no understanding They are wise in doing evil But how to do good they know not
I looked on the earth and behold it was without form and void and to the heavens and they had no light
I looked on the mountains and behold they were quaking and all the hills moved to and fro
I looked and behold there was no man and all the birds of the air had fled
I looked and behold the fruitful land was a desert and all its cities were laid in ruins before the LORD before his fierce anger
For thus says the LORD The whole land shall be a desolation yet I will not make a full end
For this the earth shall mourn and the heavens above be dark for I have spoken I have purposed I have not relented nor will I turn back
At the noise of horseman and archer every city takes to flight they enter thickets they climb among rocks all the cities are forsaken and no man dwells in them
And you O desolate one what do you mean that you dress in scarlet that you adorn yourself with ornaments of gold that you enlarge your eyes with paint In vain you beautify yourself Your lovers despise you they seek your life
For I heard a cry as of a woman in labor anguish as of one giving birth to her first child the cry of the daughter of Zion gasping for breath stretching out her hands Woe is me I am fainting before murderers
