Numbers 17
The LORD spoke to Moses saying
Speak to the people of Israel and get from them staffs one for each fathers house from all their chiefs according to their fathers houses twelve staffs Write each man s name on his staff
and write Aaron s name on the staff of Levi For there shall be one staff for the head of each fathers house
Then you shall deposit them in the tent of meeting before the testimony where I meet with you
And the staff of the man whom I choose shall sprout Thus I will make to cease from me the grumblings of the people of Israel which they grumble against you
Moses spoke to the people of Israel And all their chiefs gave him staffs one for each chief according to their fathers houses twelve staffs And the staff of Aaron was among their staffs
And Moses deposited the staffs before the LORD in the tent of the testimony
On the next day Moses went into the tent of the testimony and behold the staff of Aaron for the house of Levi had sprouted and put forth buds and produced blossoms and it bore ripe almonds
Then Moses brought out all the staffs from before the LORD to all the people of Israel And they looked and each man took his staff
And the LORD said to Moses Put back the staff of Aaron before the testimony to be kept as a sign for the rebels that you may make an end of their grumblings against me lest they die
Thus did Moses as the LORD commanded him so he did
And the people of Israel said to Moses Behold we perish we are undone we are all undone
Everyone who comes near who comes near to the tabernacle of the LORD shall die Are we all to perish
