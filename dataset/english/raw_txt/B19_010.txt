Hebrews 10
For since the law has but a shadow of the good things to come instead of the true form of these realities it can never by the same sacrifices that are continually offered every year make perfect those who draw near
Otherwise would they not have ceased to be offered since the worshipers having once been cleansed would no longer have any consciousness of sins
But in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sins every year
For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins
Consequently when Christ came into the world he said Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired but a body have you prepared for me
in burnt offerings and sin offerings you have taken no pleasure
Then I said Behold I have come to do your will O God as it is written of me in the scroll of the book
When he said above You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings these are offered according to the law
then he added Behold I have come to do your will He does away with the first in order to establish the second
And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all
And every priest stands daily at his service offering repeatedly the same sacrifices which can never take away sins
But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins he sat down at the right hand of God
waiting from that time until his enemies should be made a footstool for his feet
For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified
And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us for after saying
This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days declares the Lord I will put my laws on their hearts and write them on their minds
then he adds I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more
Where there is forgiveness of these there is no longer any offering for sin
Therefore brothers since we have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus
by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain that is through his flesh
and since we have a great priest over the house of God
let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water
Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering for he who promised is faithful
And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works
not neglecting to meet together as is the habit of some but encouraging one another and all the more as you see the Day drawing near
For if we go on sinning deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins
but a fearful expectation of judgment and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries
Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy on the evidence of two or three witnesses
How much worse punishment do you think will be deserved by the one who has spurned the Son of God and has profaned the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified and has outraged the Spirit of grace
For we know him who said Vengeance is mine I will repay And again The Lord will judge his people
It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God
But recall the former days when after you were enlightened you endured a hard struggle with sufferings
sometimes being publicly exposed to reproach and affliction and sometimes being partners with those so treated
For you had compassion on those in prison and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one
Therefore do not throw away your confidence which has a great reward
For you have need of endurance so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised
For Yet a little while and the coming one will come and will not delay
but my righteous one shall live by faith and if he shrinks back my soul has no pleasure in him
But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed but of those who have faith and preserve their souls
