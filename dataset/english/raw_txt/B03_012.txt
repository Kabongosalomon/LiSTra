Luke 12
In the meantime when so many thousands of the people had gathered together that they were trampling one another he began to say to his disciples first Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees which is hypocrisy
Nothing is covered up that will not be revealed or hidden that will not be known
Therefore whatever you have said in the dark shall be heard in the light and what you have whispered in private rooms shall be proclaimed on the housetops
I tell you my friends do not fear those who kill the body and after that have nothing more that they can do
But I will warn you whom to fear fear him who after he has killed has authority to cast into hell Yes I tell you fear him
Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies And not one of them is forgotten before God
Why even the hairs of your head are all numbered Fear not you are of more value than many sparrows
And I tell you everyone who acknowledges me before men the Son of Man also will acknowledge before the angels of God
but the one who denies me before men will be denied before the angels of God
And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven but the one who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven
And when they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities do not be anxious about how you should defend yourself or what you should say
for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say
Someone in the crowd said to him Teacher tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me
But he said to him Man who made me a judge or arbitrator over you
And he said to them Take care and be on your guard against all covetousness for one s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions
And he told them a parable saying The land of a rich man produced plentifully
and he thought to himself What shall I do for I have nowhere to store my crops
And he said I will do this I will tear down my barns and build larger ones and there I will store all my grain and my goods
And I will say to my soul Soul you have ample goods laid up for many years relax eat drink be merry
But God said to him Fool This night your soul is required of you and the things you have prepared whose will they be
So is the one who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God
And he said to his disciples Therefore I tell you do not be anxious about your life what you will eat nor about your body what you will put on
For life is more than food and the body more than clothing
Consider the ravens they neither sow nor reap they have neither storehouse nor barn and yet God feeds them Of how much more value are you than the birds
And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life
If then you are not able to do as small a thing as that why are you anxious about the rest
Consider the lilies how they grow they neither toil nor spin yet I tell you even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these
But if God so clothes the grass which is alive in the field today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven how much more will he clothe you O you of little faith
And do not seek what you are to eat and what you are to drink nor be worried
For all the nations of the world seek after these things and your Father knows that you need them
Instead seek his kingdom and these things will be added to you
Fear not little flock for it is your Father s good pleasure to give you the kingdom
Sell your possessions and give to the needy Provide yourselves with moneybags that do not grow old with a treasure in the heavens that does not fail where no thief approaches and no moth destroys
For where your treasure is there will your heart be also
Stay dressed for action and keep your lamps burning
and be like men who are waiting for their master to come home from the wedding feast so that they may open the door to him at once when he comes and knocks
Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes Truly I say to you he will dress himself for service and have them recline at table and he will come and serve them
If he comes in the second watch or in the third and finds them awake blessed are those servants
But know this that if the master of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming he would not have left his house to be broken into
You also must be ready for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect
Peter said Lord are you telling this parable for us or for all
And the Lord said Who then is the faithful and wise manager whom his master will set over his household to give them their portion of food at the proper time
Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes
Truly I say to you he will set him over all his possessions
But if that servant says to himself My master is delayed in coming and begins to beat the male and female servants and to eat and drink and get drunk
the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know and will cut him in pieces and put him with the unfaithful
And that servant who knew his master s will but did not get ready or act according to his will will receive a severe beating
But the one who did not know and did what deserved a beating will receive a light beating Everyone to whom much was given of him much will be required and from him to whom they entrusted much they will demand the more
I came to cast fire on the earth and would that it were already kindled
I have a baptism to be baptized with and how great is my distress until it is accomplished
Do you think that I have come to give peace on earth No I tell you but rather division
For from now on in one house there will be five divided three against two and two against three
They will be divided father against son and son against father mother against daughter and daughter against mother mother in law against her daughter in law and daughter in law against mother in law
He also said to the crowds When you see a cloud rising in the west you say at once A shower is coming And so it happens
And when you see the south wind blowing you say There will be scorching heat and it happens
You hypocrites You know how to interpret the appearance of earth and sky but why do you not know how to interpret the present time
And why do you not judge for yourselves what is right
As you go with your accuser before the magistrate make an effort to settle with him on the way lest he drag you to the judge and the judge hand you over to the officer and the officer put you in prison
I tell you you will never get out until you have paid the very last penny
