John 12
Six days before the Passover Jesus therefore came to Bethany where Lazarus was whom Jesus had raised from the dead
So they gave a dinner for him there Martha served and Lazarus was one of those reclining with him at table
Mary therefore took a pound of expensive ointment made from pure nard and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume
But Judas Iscariot one of his disciples he who was about to betray him said
Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor
He said this not because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief and having charge of the moneybag he used to help himself to what was put into it
Jesus said Leave her alone so that she may keep it for the day of my burial
For the poor you always have with you but you do not always have me
When the large crowd of the Jews learned that Jesus was there they came not only on account of him but also to see Lazarus whom he had raised from the dead
So the chief priests made plans to put Lazarus to death as well
because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus
The next day the large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem
So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him crying out Hosanna Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord even the King of Israel
And Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it just as it is written
Fear not daughter of Zion behold your king is coming sitting on a donkey s colt
His disciples did not understand these things at first but when Jesus was glorified then they remembered that these things had been written about him and had been done to him
The crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to bear witness
The reason why the crowd went to meet him was that they heard he had done this sign
So the Pharisees said to one another You see that you are gaining nothing Look the world has gone after him
Now among those who went up to worship at the feast were some Greeks
So these came to Philip who was from Bethsaida in Galilee and asked him Sir we wish to see Jesus
Philip went and told Andrew Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus
And Jesus answered them The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified
Truly truly I say to you unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies it remains alone but if it dies it bears much fruit
Whoever loves his life loses it and whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life
If anyone serves me he must follow me and where I am there will my servant be also If anyone serves me the Father will honor him
Now is my soul troubled And what shall I say Father save me from this hour But for this purpose I have come to this hour
Father glorify your name Then a voice came from heaven I have glorified it and I will glorify it again
The crowd that stood there and heard it said that it had thundered Others said An angel has spoken to him
Jesus answered This voice has come for your sake not mine
Now is the judgment of this world now will the ruler of this world be cast out
And I when I am lifted up from the earth will draw all people to myself
He said this to show by what kind of death he was going to die
So the crowd answered him We have heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up Who is this Son of Man
So Jesus said to them The light is among you for a little while longer Walk while you have the light lest darkness overtake you The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going
While you have the light believe in the light that you may become sons of light When Jesus had said these things he departed and hid himself from them
Though he had done so many signs before them they still did not believe in him
so that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled Lord who has believed what he heard from us and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed
Therefore they could not believe For again Isaiah said
He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart lest they see with their eyes and understand with their heart and turn and I would heal them
Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory and spoke of him
Nevertheless many even of the authorities believed in him but for fear of the Pharisees they did not confess it so that they would not be put out of the synagogue
for they loved the glory that comes from man more than the glory that comes from God
And Jesus cried out and said Whoever believes in me believes not in me but in him who sent me
And whoever sees me sees him who sent me
I have come into the world as light so that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness
If anyone hears my words and does not keep them I do not judge him for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world
The one who rejects me and does not receive my words has a judge the word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day
For I have not spoken on my own authority but the Father who sent me has himself given me a commandment what to say and what to speak
And I know that his commandment is eternal life What I say therefore I say as the Father has told me
