Hebrews 6
Therefore let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God
and of instruction about washings the laying on of hands the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment
And this we will do if God permits
For it is impossible in the case of those who have once been enlightened who have tasted the heavenly gift and have shared in the Holy Spirit
and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come
and then have fallen away to restore them again to repentance since they are crucifying once again the Son of God to their own harm and holding him up to contempt
For land that has drunk the rain that often falls on it and produces a crop useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated receives a blessing from God
But if it bears thorns and thistles it is worthless and near to being cursed and its end is to be burned
Though we speak in this way yet in your case beloved we feel sure of better things things that belong to salvation
For God is not unjust so as to overlook your work and the love that you have shown for his name in serving the saints as you still do
And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness to have the full assurance of hope until the end
so that you may not be sluggish but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises
For when God made a promise to Abraham since he had no one greater by whom to swear he swore by himself
saying Surely I will bless you and multiply you
And thus Abraham having patiently waited obtained the promise
For people swear by something greater than themselves and in all their disputes an oath is final for confirmation
So when God desired to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose he guaranteed it with an oath
so that by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us
We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul a hope that enters into the inner place behind the curtain
where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek
