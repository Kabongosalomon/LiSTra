Zechariah 1
In the eighth month in the second year of Darius the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah the son of Berechiah son of Iddo saying
The LORD was very angry with your fathers
Therefore say to them Thus declares the LORD of hosts Return to me says the LORD of hosts and I will return to you says the LORD of hosts
Do not be like your fathers to whom the former prophets cried out Thus says the LORD of hosts Return from your evil ways and from your evil deeds But they did not hear or pay attention to me declares the LORD
Your fathers where are they And the prophets do they live forever
But my words and my statutes which I commanded my servants the prophets did they not overtake your fathers So they repented and said As the LORD of hosts purposed to deal with us for our ways and deeds so has he dealt with us
On the twenty fourth day of the eleventh month which is the month of Shebat in the second year of Darius the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah the son of Berechiah son of Iddo saying
I saw in the night and behold a man riding on a red horse He was standing among the myrtle trees in the glen and behind him were red sorrel and white horses
Then I said What are these my lord The angel who talked with me said to me I will show you what they are
So the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered These are they whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth
And they answered the angel of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees and said We have patrolled the earth and behold all the earth remains at rest
Then the angel of the LORD said O LORD of hosts how long will you have no mercy on Jerusalem and the cities of Judah against which you have been angry these seventy years
And the LORD answered gracious and comforting words to the angel who talked with me
So the angel who talked with me said to me Cry out Thus says the LORD of hosts I am exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion
And I am exceedingly angry with the nations that are at ease for while I was angry but a little they furthered the disaster
Therefore thus says the LORD I have returned to Jerusalem with mercy my house shall be built in it declares the LORD of hosts and the measuring line shall be stretched out over Jerusalem
Cry out again Thus says the LORD of hosts My cities shall again overflow with prosperity and the LORD will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem
And I lifted my eyes and saw and behold four horns
And I said to the angel who talked with me What are these And he said to me These are the horns that have scattered Judah Israel and Jerusalem
Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen
And I said What are these coming to do He said These are the horns that scattered Judah so that no one raised his head And these have come to terrify them to cast down the horns of the nations who lifted up their horns against the land of Judah to scatter it
