1 Corienthians 12
Now concerning spiritual gifts brothers I do not want you to be uninformed
You know that when you were pagans you were led astray to mute idols however you were led
Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking in the Spirit of God ever says Jesus is accursed and no one can say Jesus is Lord except in the Holy Spirit
Now there are varieties of gifts but the same Spirit
and there are varieties of service but the same Lord
and there are varieties of activities but it is the same God who empowers them all in everyone
To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good
For to one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit
to another faith by the same Spirit to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit
to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another the ability to distinguish between spirits to another various kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues
All these are empowered by one and the same Spirit who apportions to each one individually as he wills
For just as the body is one and has many members and all the members of the body though many are one body so it is with Christ
For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body Jews or Greeks slaves or free and all were made to drink of one Spirit
For the body does not consist of one member but of many
If the foot should say Because I am not a hand I do not belong to the body that would not make it any less a part of the body
And if the ear should say Because I am not an eye I do not belong to the body that would not make it any less a part of the body
If the whole body were an eye where would be the sense of hearing If the whole body were an ear where would be the sense of smell
But as it is God arranged the members in the body each one of them as he chose
If all were a single member where would the body be
As it is there are many parts yet one body
The eye cannot say to the hand I have no need of you nor again the head to the feet I have no need of you
On the contrary the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable
and on those parts of the body that we think less honorable we bestow the greater honor and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty
which our more presentable parts do not require But God has so composed the body giving greater honor to the part that lacked it
that there may be no division in the body but that the members may have the same care for one another
If one member suffers all suffer together if one member is honored all rejoice together
Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it
And God has appointed in the church first apostles second prophets third teachers then miracles then gifts of healing helping administrating and various kinds of tongues
Are all apostles Are all prophets Are all teachers Do all work miracles
Do all possess gifts of healing Do all speak with tongues Do all interpret
But earnestly desire the higher gifts And I will show you a still more excellent way
