Job 25
Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said
Dominion and fear are with God he makes peace in his high heaven
Is there any number to his armies Upon whom does his light not arise
How then can man be in the right before God How can he who is born of woman be pure
Behold even the moon is not bright and the stars are not pure in his eyes
how much less man who is a maggot and the son of man who is a worm
