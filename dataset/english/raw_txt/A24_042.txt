Jeremiah 42
Then all the commanders of the forces and Johanan the son of Kareah and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah and all the people from the least to the greatest came near
and said to Jeremiah the prophet Let our plea for mercy come before you and pray to the LORD your God for us for all this remnant because we are left with but a few as your eyes see us
that the LORD your God may show us the way we should go and the thing that we should do
Jeremiah the prophet said to them I have heard you Behold I will pray to the LORD your God according to your request and whatever the LORD answers you I will tell you I will keep nothing back from you
Then they said to Jeremiah May the LORD be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not act according to all the word with which the LORD your God sends you to us
Whether it is good or bad we will obey the voice of the LORD our God to whom we are sending you that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of the LORD our God
At the end of ten days the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah
Then he summoned Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces who were with him and all the people from the least to the greatest
and said to them Thus says the LORD the God of Israel to whom you sent me to present your plea for mercy before him
If you will remain in this land then I will build you up and not pull you down I will plant you and not pluck you up for I relent of the disaster that I did to you
Do not fear the king of Babylon of whom you are afraid Do not fear him declares the LORD for I am with you to save you and to deliver you from his hand
I will grant you mercy that he may have mercy on you and let you remain in your own land
But if you say We will not remain in this land disobeying the voice of the LORD your God
and saying No we will go to the land of Egypt where we shall not see war or hear the sound of the trumpet or be hungry for bread and we will dwell there
then hear the word of the LORD O remnant of Judah Thus says the LORD of hosts the God of Israel If you set your faces to enter Egypt and go to live there
then the sword that you fear shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt and the famine of which you are afraid shall follow close after you to Egypt and there you shall die
All the men who set their faces to go to Egypt to live there shall die by the sword by famine and by pestilence They shall have no remnant or survivor from the disaster that I will bring upon them
For thus says the LORD of hosts the God of Israel As my anger and my wrath were poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem so my wrath will be poured out on you when you go to Egypt You shall become an execration a horror a curse and a taunt You shall see this place no more
The LORD has said to you O remnant of Judah Do not go to Egypt Know for a certainty that I have warned you this day
that you have gone astray at the cost of your lives For you sent me to the LORD your God saying Pray for us to the LORD our God and whatever the LORD our God says declare to us and we will do it
And I have this day declared it to you but you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God in anything that he sent me to tell you
Now therefore know for a certainty that you shall die by the sword by famine and by pestilence in the place where you desire to go to live
