Job 28
Surely there is a mine for silver and a place for gold that they refine
Iron is taken out of the earth and copper is smelted from the ore
Man puts an end to darkness and searches out to the farthest limit the ore in gloom and deep darkness
He opens shafts in a valley away from where anyone lives they are forgotten by travelers they hang in the air far away from mankind they swing to and fro
As for the earth out of it comes bread but underneath it is turned up as by fire
Its stones are the place of sapphires and it has dust of gold
That path no bird of prey knows and the falcon s eye has not seen it
The proud beasts have not trodden it the lion has not passed over it
Man puts his hand to the flinty rock and overturns mountains by the roots
He cuts out channels in the rocks and his eye sees every precious thing
He dams up the streams so that they do not trickle and the thing that is hidden he brings out to light
But where shall wisdom be found And where is the place of understanding
Man does not know its worth and it is not found in the land of the living
The deep says It is not in me and the sea says It is not with me
It cannot be bought for gold and silver cannot be weighed as its price
It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir in precious onyx or sapphire
Gold and glass cannot equal it nor can it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold
No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal the price of wisdom is above pearls
The topaz of Ethiopia cannot equal it nor can it be valued in pure gold
From where then does wisdom come And where is the place of understanding
It is hidden from the eyes of all living and concealed from the birds of the air
Abaddon and Death say We have heard a rumor of it with our ears
God understands the way to it and he knows its place
For he looks to the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens
When he gave to the wind its weight and apportioned the waters by measure
when he made a decree for the rain and a way for the lightning of the thunder
then he saw it and declared it he established it and searched it out
And he said to man Behold the fear of the Lord that is wisdom and to turn away from evil is understanding
