Genesis 27
When Isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see he called Esau his older son and said to him My son and he answered Here I am
He said Behold I am old I do not know the day of my death
Now then take your weapons your quiver and your bow and go out to the field and hunt game for me
and prepare for me delicious food such as I love and bring it to me so that I may eat that my soul may bless you before I die
Now Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to his son Esau So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game and bring it
Rebekah said to her son Jacob I heard your father speak to your brother Esau
Bring me game and prepare for me delicious food that I may eat it and bless you before the LORD before I die
Now therefore my son obey my voice as I command you
Go to the flock and bring me two good young goats so that I may prepare from them delicious food for your father such as he loves
And you shall bring it to your father to eat so that he may bless you before he dies
But Jacob said to Rebekah his mother Behold my brother Esau is a hairy man and I am a smooth man
Perhaps my father will feel me and I shall seem to be mocking him and bring a curse upon myself and not a blessing
His mother said to him Let your curse be on me my son only obey my voice and go bring them to me
So he went and took them and brought them to his mother and his mother prepared delicious food such as his father loved
Then Rebekah took the best garments of Esau her older son which were with her in the house and put them on Jacob her younger son
And the skins of the young goats she put on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck
And she put the delicious food and the bread which she had prepared into the hand of her son Jacob
So he went in to his father and said My father And he said Here I am Who are you my son
Jacob said to his father I am Esau your firstborn I have done as you told me now sit up and eat of my game that your soul may bless me
But Isaac said to his son How is it that you have found it so quickly my son He answered Because the LORD your God granted me success
Then Isaac said to Jacob Please come near that I may feel you my son to know whether you are really my son Esau or not
So Jacob went near to Isaac his father who felt him and said The voice is Jacob s voice but the hands are the hands of Esau
And he did not recognize him because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau s hands So he blessed him
He said Are you really my son Esau He answered I am
Then he said Bring it near to me that I may eat of my son s game and bless you So he brought it near to him and he ate and he brought him wine and he drank
Then his father Isaac said to him Come near and kiss me my son
So he came near and kissed him And Isaac smelled the smell of his garments and blessed him and said See the smell of my son is as the smell of a field that the LORD has blessed
May God give you of the dew of heaven and of the fatness of the earth and plenty of grain and wine
Let peoples serve you and nations bow down to you Be lord over your brothers and may your mother s sons bow down to you Cursed be everyone who curses you and blessed be everyone who blesses you
As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob when Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father Esau his brother came in from his hunting
He also prepared delicious food and brought it to his father And he said to his father Let my father arise and eat of his son s game that you may bless me
His father Isaac said to him Who are you He answered I am your son your firstborn Esau
Then Isaac trembled very violently and said Who was it then that hunted game and brought it to me and I ate it all before you came and I have blessed him Yes and he shall be blessed
As soon as Esau heard the words of his father he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry and said to his father Bless me even me also O my father
But he said Your brother came deceitfully and he has taken away your blessing
Esau said Is he not rightly named Jacob For he has cheated me these two times He took away my birthright and behold now he has taken away my blessing Then he said Have you not reserved a blessing for me
Isaac answered and said to Esau Behold I have made him lord over you and all his brothers I have given to him for servants and with grain and wine I have sustained him What then can I do for you my son
Esau said to his father Have you but one blessing my father Bless me even me also O my father And Esau lifted up his voice and wept
Then Isaac his father answered and said to him Behold away from the fatness of the earth shall your dwelling be and away from the dew of heaven on high
By your sword you shall live and you shall serve your brother but when you grow restless you shall break his yoke from your neck
Now Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him and Esau said to himself The days of mourning for my father are approaching then I will kill my brother Jacob
But the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah So she sent and called Jacob her younger son and said to him Behold your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you
Now therefore my son obey my voice Arise flee to Laban my brother in Haran
and stay with him a while until your brother s fury turns away
until your brother s anger turns away from you and he forgets what you have done to him Then I will send and bring you from there Why should I be bereft of you both in one day
Then Rebekah said to Isaac I loathe my life because of the Hittite women If Jacob marries one of the Hittite women like these one of the women of the land what good will my life be to me
