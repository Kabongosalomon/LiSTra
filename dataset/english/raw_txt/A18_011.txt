Job 11
Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said
Should a multitude of words go unanswered and a man full of talk be judged right
Should your babble silence men and when you mock shall no one shame you
For you say My doctrine is pure and I am clean in God s eyes
But oh that God would speak and open his lips to you
and that he would tell you the secrets of wisdom For he is manifold in understanding Know then that God exacts of you less than your guilt deserves
Can you find out the deep things of God Can you find out the limit of the Almighty
It is higher than heaven what can you do Deeper than Sheol what can you know
Its measure is longer than the earth and broader than the sea
If he passes through and imprisons and summons the court who can turn him back
For he knows worthless men when he sees iniquity will he not consider it
But a stupid man will get understanding when a wild donkey s colt is born a man
If you prepare your heart you will stretch out your hands toward him
If iniquity is in your hand put it far away and let not injustice dwell in your tents
Surely then you will lift up your face without blemish you will be secure and will not fear
You will forget your misery you will remember it as waters that have passed away
And your life will be brighter than the noonday its darkness will be like the morning
And you will feel secure because there is hope you will look around and take your rest in security
You will lie down and none will make you afraid many will court your favor
But the eyes of the wicked will fail all way of escape will be lost to them and their hope is to breathe their last
