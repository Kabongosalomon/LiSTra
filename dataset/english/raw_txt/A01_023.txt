Genesis 23
Sarah lived years these were the years of the life of Sarah
And Sarah died at Kiriath arba that is Hebron in the land of Canaan and Abraham went in to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her
And Abraham rose up from before his dead and said to the Hittites
I am a sojourner and foreigner among you give me property among you for a burying place that I may bury my dead out of my sight
The Hittites answered Abraham
Hear us my lord you are a prince of God among us Bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs None of us will withhold from you his tomb to hinder you from burying your dead
Abraham rose and bowed to the Hittites the people of the land
And he said to them If you are willing that I should bury my dead out of my sight hear me and entreat for me Ephron the son of Zohar
that he may give me the cave of Machpelah which he owns it is at the end of his field For the full price let him give it to me in your presence as property for a burying place
Now Ephron was sitting among the Hittites and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the Hittites of all who went in at the gate of his city
No my lord hear me I give you the field and I give you the cave that is in it In the sight of the sons of my people I give it to you Bury your dead
Then Abraham bowed down before the people of the land
And he said to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land But if you will hear me I give the price of the field Accept it from me that I may bury my dead there
Ephron answered Abraham
My lord listen to me a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver what is that between you and me Bury your dead
Abraham listened to Ephron and Abraham weighed out for Ephron the silver that he had named in the hearing of the Hittites four hundred shekels of silver according to the weights current among the merchants
So the field of Ephron in Machpelah which was to the east of Mamre the field with the cave that was in it and all the trees that were in the field throughout its whole area was made over
to Abraham as a possession in the presence of the Hittites before all who went in at the gate of his city
After this Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah east of Mamre that is Hebron in the land of Canaan
The field and the cave that is in it were made over to Abraham as property for a burying place by the Hittites
