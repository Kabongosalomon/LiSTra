Proverbs 31
The words of King Lemuel An oracle that his mother taught him
What are you doing my son What are you doing son of my womb What are you doing son of my vows
Do not give your strength to women your ways to those who destroy kings
It is not for kings O Lemuel it is not for kings to drink wine or for rulers to take strong drink
lest they drink and forget what has been decreed and pervert the rights of all the afflicted
Give strong drink to the one who is perishing and wine to those in bitter distress
let them drink and forget their poverty and remember their misery no more
Open your mouth for the mute for the rights of all who are destitute
Open your mouth judge righteously defend the rights of the poor and needy
An excellent wife who can find She is far more precious than jewels
The heart of her husband trusts in her and he will have no lack of gain
She does him good and not harm all the days of her life
She seeks wool and flax and works with willing hands
She is like the ships of the merchant she brings her food from afar
She rises while it is yet night and provides food for her household and portions for her maidens
She considers a field and buys it with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard
She dresses herself with strength and makes her arms strong
She perceives that her merchandise is profitable Her lamp does not go out at night
She puts her hands to the distaff and her hands hold the spindle
She opens her hand to the poor and reaches out her hands to the needy
She is not afraid of snow for her household for all her household are clothed in scarlet
She makes bed coverings for herself her clothing is fine linen and purple
Her husband is known in the gates when he sits among the elders of the land
She makes linen garments and sells them she delivers sashes to the merchant
Strength and dignity are her clothing and she laughs at the time to come
She opens her mouth with wisdom and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue
She looks well to the ways of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness
Her children rise up and call her blessed her husband also and he praises her
Many women have done excellently but you surpass them all
Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised
Give her of the fruit of her hands and let her works praise her in the gates
