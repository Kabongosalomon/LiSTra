Ezekiel 30
The word of the LORD came to me
Son of man prophesy and say Thus says the Lord GOD Wail Alas for the day
For the day is near the day of the LORD is near it will be a day of clouds a time of doom for the nations
A sword shall come upon Egypt and anguish shall be in Cush when the slain fall in Egypt and her wealth is carried away and her foundations are torn down
Cush and Put and Lud and all Arabia and Libya and the people of the land that is in league shall fall with them by the sword
Thus says the LORD Those who support Egypt shall fall and her proud might shall come down from Migdol to Syene they shall fall within her by the sword declares the Lord GOD
And they shall be desolated in the midst of desolated countries and their cities shall be in the midst of cities that are laid waste
Then they will know that I am the LORD when I have set fire to Egypt and all her helpers are broken
On that day messengers shall go out from me in ships to terrify the unsuspecting people of Cush and anguish shall come upon them on the day of Egypt s doom for behold it comes
Thus says the Lord GOD I will put an end to the wealth of Egypt by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
He and his people with him the most ruthless of nations shall be brought in to destroy the land and they shall draw their swords against Egypt and fill the land with the slain
And I will dry up the Nile and will sell the land into the hand of evildoers I will bring desolation upon the land and everything in it by the hand of foreigners I am the LORD I have spoken
Thus says the Lord GOD I will destroy the idols and put an end to the images in Memphis there shall no longer be a prince from the land of Egypt so I will put fear in the land of Egypt
I will make Pathros a desolation and will set fire to Zoan and will execute judgments on Thebes
And I will pour out my wrath on Pelusium the stronghold of Egypt and cut off the multitude of Thebes
And I will set fire to Egypt Pelusium shall be in great agony Thebes shall be breached and Memphis shall face enemies by day
The young men of On and of Pi beseth shall fall by the sword and the women shall go into captivity
At Tehaphnehes the day shall be dark when I break there the yoke bars of Egypt and her proud might shall come to an end in her she shall be covered by a cloud and her daughters shall go into captivity
Thus I will execute judgments on Egypt Then they will know that I am the LORD
In the eleventh year in the first month on the seventh day of the month the word of the LORD came to me
Son of man I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt and behold it has not been bound up to heal it by binding it with a bandage so that it may become strong to wield the sword
Therefore thus says the Lord GOD Behold I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt and will break his arms both the strong arm and the one that was broken and I will make the sword fall from his hand
I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them through the countries
And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and put my sword in his hand but I will break the arms of Pharaoh and he will groan before him like a man mortally wounded
I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon but the arms of Pharaoh shall fall Then they shall know that I am the LORD when I put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon and he stretches it out against the land of Egypt
And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them throughout the countries Then they will know that I am the LORD
