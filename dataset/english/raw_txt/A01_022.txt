Genesis 22
After these things God tested Abraham and said to him Abraham And he said Here am I
He said Take your son your only son Isaac whom you love and go to the land of Moriah and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you
So Abraham rose early in the morning saddled his donkey and took two of his young men with him and his son Isaac And he cut the wood for the burnt offering and arose and went to the place of which God had told him
On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from afar
Then Abraham said to his young men Stay here with the donkey I and the boy will go over there and worship and come again to you
And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son And he took in his hand the fire and the knife So they went both of them together
And Isaac said to his father Abraham My father And he said Here am I my son He said Behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for a burnt offering
Abraham said God will provide for himself the lamb for a burnt offering my son So they went both of them together
When they came to the place of which God had told him Abraham built the altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar on top of the wood
Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son
But the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven and said Abraham Abraham And he said Here am I
He said Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him for now I know that you fear God seeing you have not withheld your son your only son from me
And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him was a ram caught in a thicket by his horns And Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son
So Abraham called the name of that place The LORD will provide as it is said to this day On the mount of the LORD it shall be provided
And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham a second time from heaven
and said By myself I have sworn declares the LORD because you have done this and have not withheld your son your only son
I will surely bless you and I will surely multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the seashore And your offspring shall possess the gate of his enemies
and in your offspring shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because you have obeyed my voice
So Abraham returned to his young men and they arose and went together to Beersheba And Abraham lived at Beersheba
Now after these things it was told to Abraham Behold Milcah also has borne children to your brother Nahor
Uz his firstborn Buz his brother Kemuel the father of Aram
Chesed Hazo Pildash Jidlaph and Bethuel
Bethuel fathered Rebekah These eight Milcah bore to Nahor Abraham s brother
Moreover his concubine whose name was Reumah bore Tebah Gaham Tahash and Maacah
