Revelation 5
Then I saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the throne a scroll written within and on the back sealed with seven seals
And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals
And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it
and I began to weep loudly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it
And one of the elders said to me Weep no more behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah the Root of David has conquered so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals
And between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders I saw a Lamb standing as though it had been slain with seven horns and with seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth
And he went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who was seated on the throne
And when he had taken the scroll the four living creatures and the twenty four elders fell down before the Lamb each holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense which are the prayers of the saints
And they sang a new song saying Worthy are you to take the scroll and to open its seals for you were slain and by your blood you ransomed people for God from every tribe and language and people and nation
and you have made them a kingdom and priests to our God and they shall reign on the earth
Then I looked and I heard around the throne and the living creatures and the elders the voice of many angels numbering myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands
saying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing
And I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea and all that is in them saying To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honor and glory and might forever and ever
And the four living creatures said Amen and the elders fell down and worshiped
