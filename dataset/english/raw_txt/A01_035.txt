Genesis 35
God said to Jacob Arise go up to Bethel and dwell there Make an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau
So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him Put away the foreign gods that are among you and purify yourselves and change your garments
Then let us arise and go up to Bethel so that I may make there an altar to the God who answers me in the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone
So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods that they had and the rings that were in their ears Jacob hid them under the terebinth tree that was near Shechem
And as they journeyed a terror from God fell upon the cities that were around them so that they did not pursue the sons of Jacob
And Jacob came to Luz that is Bethel which is in the land of Canaan he and all the people who were with him
and there he built an altar and called the place El bethel because there God had revealed himself to him when he fled from his brother
And Deborah Rebekah s nurse died and she was buried under an oak below Bethel So he called its name Allon bacuth
God appeared to Jacob again when he came from Paddan aram and blessed him
And God said to him Your name is Jacob no longer shall your name be called Jacob but Israel shall be your name So he called his name Israel
And God said to him I am God Almighty be fruitful and multiply A nation and a company of nations shall come from you and kings shall come from your own body
The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you and I will give the land to your offspring after you
Then God went up from him in the place where he had spoken with him
And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him a pillar of stone He poured out a drink offering on it and poured oil on it
So Jacob called the name of the place where God had spoken with him Bethel
Then they journeyed from Bethel When they were still some distance from Ephrath Rachel went into labor and she had hard labor
And when her labor was at its hardest the midwife said to her Do not fear for you have another son
And as her soul was departing for she was dying she called his name Ben oni but his father called him Benjamin
So Rachel died and she was buried on the way to Ephrath that is Bethlehem
and Jacob set up a pillar over her tomb It is the pillar of Rachel s tomb which is there to this day
Israel journeyed on and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder
While Israel lived in that land Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father s concubine And Israel heard of it Now the sons of Jacob were twelve
The sons of Leah Reuben Jacob s firstborn Simeon Levi Judah Issachar and Zebulun
The sons of Rachel Joseph and Benjamin
The sons of Bilhah Rachel s servant Dan and Naphtali
The sons of Zilpah Leah s servant Gad and Asher These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan aram
And Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre or Kiriath arba that is Hebron where Abraham and Isaac had sojourned
Now the days of Isaac were years
And Isaac breathed his last and he died and was gathered to his people old and full of days And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him
