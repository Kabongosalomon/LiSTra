Zechariah 11
Open your doors O Lebanon that the fire may devour your cedars
Wail O cypress for the cedar has fallen for the glorious trees are ruined Wail oaks of Bashan for the thick forest has been felled
The sound of the wail of the shepherds for their glory is ruined The sound of the roar of the lions for the thicket of the Jordan is ruined
Thus said the LORD my God Become shepherd of the flock doomed to slaughter
Those who buy them slaughter them and go unpunished and those who sell them say Blessed be the LORD I have become rich and their own shepherds have no pity on them
For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of this land declares the LORD Behold I will cause each of them to fall into the hand of his neighbor and each into the hand of his king and they shall crush the land and I will deliver none from their hand
So I became the shepherd of the flock doomed to be slaughtered by the sheep traders And I took two staffs one I named Favor the other I named Union And I tended the sheep
In one month I destroyed the three shepherds But I became impatient with them and they also detested me
So I said I will not be your shepherd What is to die let it die What is to be destroyed let it be destroyed And let those who are left devour the flesh of one another
And I took my staff Favor and I broke it annulling the covenant that I had made with all the peoples
So it was annulled on that day and the sheep traders who were watching me knew that it was the word of the LORD
Then I said to them If it seems good to you give me my wages but if not keep them And they weighed out as my wages thirty pieces of silver
Then the LORD said to me Throw it to the potter the lordly price at which I was priced by them So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the house of the LORD to the potter
Then I broke my second staff Union annulling the brotherhood between Judah and Israel
Then the LORD said to me Take once more the equipment of a foolish shepherd
For behold I am raising up in the land a shepherd who does not care for those being destroyed or seek the young or heal the maimed or nourish the healthy but devours the flesh of the fat ones tearing off even their hoofs
Woe to my worthless shepherd who deserts the flock May the sword strike his arm and his right eye Let his arm be wholly withered his right eye utterly blinded
