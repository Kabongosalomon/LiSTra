Jonah 1
Now the word of the LORD came to Jonah the son of Amittai saying
Arise go to Nineveh that great city and call out against it for their evil has come up before me
But Jonah rose to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD He went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish So he paid the fare and went on board to go with them to Tarshish away from the presence of the LORD
But the LORD hurled a great wind upon the sea and there was a mighty tempest on the sea so that the ship threatened to break up
Then the mariners were afraid and each cried out to his god And they hurled the cargo that was in the ship into the sea to lighten it for them But Jonah had gone down into the inner part of the ship and had lain down and was fast asleep
So the captain came and said to him What do you mean you sleeper Arise call out to your god Perhaps the god will give a thought to us that we may not perish
And they said to one another Come let us cast lots that we may know on whose account this evil has come upon us So they cast lots and the lot fell on Jonah
Then they said to him Tell us on whose account this evil has come upon us What is your occupation And where do you come from What is your country And of what people are you
And he said to them I am a Hebrew and I fear the LORD the God of heaven who made the sea and the dry land
Then the men were exceedingly afraid and said to him What is this that you have done For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the LORD because he had told them
Then they said to him What shall we do to you that the sea may quiet down for us For the sea grew more and more tempestuous
He said to them Pick me up and hurl me into the sea then the sea will quiet down for you for I know it is because of me that this great tempest has come upon you
Nevertheless the men rowed hard to get back to dry land but they could not for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them
Therefore they called out to the LORD O LORD let us not perish for this man s life and lay not on us innocent blood for you O LORD have done as it pleased you
So they picked up Jonah and hurled him into the sea and the sea ceased from its raging
Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly and they offered a sacrifice to the LORD and made vows
And the LORD appointed a great fish to swallow up Jonah And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights
