Hebrews 9
Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly place of holiness
For a tent was prepared the first section in which were the lampstand and the table and the bread of the Presence It is called the Holy Place
Behind the second curtain was a second section called the Most Holy Place
having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold in which was a golden urn holding the manna and Aaron s staff that budded and the tablets of the covenant
Above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat Of these things we cannot now speak in detail
These preparations having thus been made the priests go regularly into the first section performing their ritual duties
but into the second only the high priest goes and he but once a year and not without taking blood which he offers for himself and for the unintentional sins of the people
By this the Holy Spirit indicates that the way into the holy places is not yet opened as long as the first section is still standing
which is symbolic for the present age According to this arrangement gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper
but deal only with food and drink and various washings regulations for the body imposed until the time of reformation
But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come then through the greater and more perfect tent not made with hands that is not of this creation
he entered once for all into the holy places not by means of the blood of goats and calves but by means of his own blood thus securing an eternal redemption
For if the blood of goats and bulls and the sprinkling of defiled persons with the ashes of a heifer sanctify for the purification of the flesh
how much more will the blood of Christ who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God
Therefore he is the mediator of a new covenant so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance since a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions committed under the first covenant
For where a will is involved the death of the one who made it must be established
For a will takes effect only at death since it is not in force as long as the one who made it is alive
Therefore not even the first covenant was inaugurated without blood
For when every commandment of the law had been declared by Moses to all the people he took the blood of calves and goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people
saying This is the blood of the covenant that God commanded for you
And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tent and all the vessels used in worship
Indeed under the law almost everything is purified with blood and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins
Thus it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these rites but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these
For Christ has entered not into holy places made with hands which are copies of the true things but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf
Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own
for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world But as it is he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself
And just as it is appointed for man to die once and after that comes judgment
so Christ having been offered once to bear the sins of many will appear a second time not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him
