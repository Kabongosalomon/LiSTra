Job 21
Then Job answered and said
Keep listening to my words and let this be your comfort
Bear with me and I will speak and after I have spoken mock on
As for me is my complaint against man Why should I not be impatient
Look at me and be appalled and lay your hand over your mouth
When I remember I am dismayed and shuddering seizes my flesh
Why do the wicked live reach old age and grow mighty in power
Their offspring are established in their presence and their descendants before their eyes
Their houses are safe from fear and no rod of God is upon them
Their bull breeds without fail their cow calves and does not miscarry
They send out their little boys like a flock and their children dance
They sing to the tambourine and the lyre and rejoice to the sound of the pipe
They spend their days in prosperity and in peace they go down to Sheol
They say to God Depart from us We do not desire the knowledge of your ways
What is the Almighty that we should serve him And what profit do we get if we pray to him
Behold is not their prosperity in their hand The counsel of the wicked is far from me
How often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out That their calamity comes upon them That God distributes pains in his anger
That they are like straw before the wind and like chaff that the storm carries away
You say God stores up their iniquity for their children Let him pay it out to them that they may know it
Let their own eyes see their destruction and let them drink of the wrath of the Almighty
For what do they care for their houses after them when the number of their months is cut off
Will any teach God knowledge seeing that he judges those who are on high
One dies in his full vigor being wholly at ease and secure
his pails full of milk and the marrow of his bones moist
Another dies in bitterness of soul never having tasted of prosperity
They lie down alike in the dust and the worms cover them
Behold I know your thoughts and your schemes to wrong me
For you say Where is the house of the prince Where is the tent in which the wicked lived
Have you not asked those who travel the roads and do you not accept their testimony
that the evil man is spared in the day of calamity that he is rescued in the day of wrath
Who declares his way to his face and who repays him for what he has done
When he is carried to the grave watch is kept over his tomb
The clods of the valley are sweet to him all mankind follows after him and those who go before him are innumerable
How then will you comfort me with empty nothings There is nothing left of your answers but falsehood
