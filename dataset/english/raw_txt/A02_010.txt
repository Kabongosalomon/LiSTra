Exodus 10
Then the LORD said to Moses Go in to Pharaoh for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants that I may show these signs of mine among them
and that you may tell in the hearing of your son and of your grandson how I have dealt harshly with the Egyptians and what signs I have done among them that you may know that I am the LORD
So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh and said to him Thus says the LORD the God of the Hebrews How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me Let my people go that they may serve me
For if you refuse to let my people go behold tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country
and they shall cover the face of the land so that no one can see the land And they shall eat what is left to you after the hail and they shall eat every tree of yours that grows in the field
and they shall fill your houses and the houses of all your servants and of all the Egyptians as neither your fathers nor your grandfathers have seen from the day they came on earth to this day Then he turned and went out from Pharaoh
Then Pharaoh s servants said to him How long shall this man be a snare to us Let the men go that they may serve the LORD their God Do you not yet understand that Egypt is ruined
So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh And he said to them Go serve the LORD your God But which ones are to go
Moses said We will go with our young and our old We will go with our sons and daughters and with our flocks and herds for we must hold a feast to the LORD
But he said to them The LORD be with you if ever I let you and your little ones go Look you have some evil purpose in mind
No Go the men among you and serve the LORD for that is what you are asking And they were driven out from Pharaoh s presence
Then the LORD said to Moses Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts so that they may come upon the land of Egypt and eat every plant in the land all that the hail has left
So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all that night When it was morning the east wind had brought the locusts
The locusts came up over all the land of Egypt and settled on the whole country of Egypt such a dense swarm of locusts as had never been before nor ever will be again
They covered the face of the whole land so that the land was darkened and they ate all the plants in the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left Not a green thing remained neither tree nor plant of the field through all the land of Egypt
Then Pharaoh hastily called Moses and Aaron and said I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you
Now therefore forgive my sin please only this once and plead with the LORD your God only to remove this death from me
So he went out from Pharaoh and pleaded with the LORD
And the LORD turned the wind into a very strong west wind which lifted the locusts and drove them into the Red Sea Not a single locust was left in all the country of Egypt
But the LORD hardened Pharaoh s heart and he did not let the people of Israel go
Then the LORD said to Moses Stretch out your hand toward heaven that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt a darkness to be felt
So Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven and there was pitch darkness in all the land of Egypt three days
They did not see one another nor did anyone rise from his place for three days but all the people of Israel had light where they lived
Then Pharaoh called Moses and said Go serve the LORD your little ones also may go with you only let your flocks and your herds remain behind
But Moses said You must also let us have sacrifices and burnt offerings that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God
Our livestock also must go with us not a hoof shall be left behind for we must take of them to serve the LORD our God and we do not know with what we must serve the LORD until we arrive there
But the LORD hardened Pharaoh s heart and he would not let them go
Then Pharaoh said to him Get away from me take care never to see my face again for on the day you see my face you shall die
Moses said As you say I will not see your face again
