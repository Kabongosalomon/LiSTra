Proverbs 28
The wicked flee when no one pursues but the righteous are bold as a lion
When a land transgresses it has many rulers but with a man of understanding and knowledge its stability will long continue
A poor man who oppresses the poor is a beating rain that leaves no food
Those who forsake the law praise the wicked but those who keep the law strive against them
Evil men do not understand justice but those who seek the LORD understand it completely
Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity than a rich man who is crooked in his ways
The one who keeps the law is a son with understanding but a companion of gluttons shames his father
Whoever multiplies his wealth by interest and profit gathers it for him who is generous to the poor
If one turns away his ear from hearing the law even his prayer is an abomination
Whoever misleads the upright into an evil way will fall into his own pit but the blameless will have a goodly inheritance
A rich man is wise in his own eyes but a poor man who has understanding will find him out
When the righteous triumph there is great glory but when the wicked rise people hide themselves
Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy
Blessed is the one who fears the LORD always but whoever hardens his heart will fall into calamity
Like a roaring lion or a charging bear is a wicked ruler over a poor people
A ruler who lacks understanding is a cruel oppressor but he who hates unjust gain will prolong his days
If one is burdened with the blood of another he will be a fugitive until death let no one help him
Whoever walks in integrity will be delivered but he who is crooked in his ways will suddenly fall
Whoever works his land will have plenty of bread but he who follows worthless pursuits will have plenty of poverty
A faithful man will abound with blessings but whoever hastens to be rich will not go unpunished
To show partiality is not good but for a piece of bread a man will do wrong
A stingy man hastens after wealth and does not know that poverty will come upon him
Whoever rebukes a man will afterward find more favor than he who flatters with his tongue
Whoever robs his father or his mother and says That is no transgression is a companion to a man who destroys
A greedy man stirs up strife but the one who trusts in the LORD will be enriched
Whoever trusts in his own mind is a fool but he who walks in wisdom will be delivered
Whoever gives to the poor will not want but he who hides his eyes will get many a curse
When the wicked rise people hide themselves but when they perish the righteous increase
