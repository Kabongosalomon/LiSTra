Luke 9
And he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases
and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal
And he said to them Take nothing for your journey no staff nor bag nor bread nor money and do not have two tunics
And whatever house you enter stay there and from there depart
And wherever they do not receive you when you leave that town shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them
And they departed and went through the villages preaching the gospel and healing everywhere
Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening and he was perplexed because it was said by some that John had been raised from the dead
by some that Elijah had appeared and by others that one of the prophets of old had risen
Herod said John I beheaded but who is this about whom I hear such things And he sought to see him
On their return the apostles told him all that they had done And he took them and withdrew apart to a town called Bethsaida
When the crowds learned it they followed him and he welcomed them and spoke to them of the kingdom of God and cured those who had need of healing
Now the day began to wear away and the twelve came and said to him Send the crowd away to go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find lodging and get provisions for we are here in a desolate place
But he said to them You give them something to eat They said We have no more than five loaves and two fish unless we are to go and buy food for all these people
For there were about five thousand men And he said to his disciples Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each
And they did so and had them all sit down
And taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven and said a blessing over them Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd
And they all ate and were satisfied And what was left over was picked up twelve baskets of broken pieces
Now it happened that as he was praying alone the disciples were with him And he asked them Who do the crowds say that I am
And they answered John the Baptist But others say Elijah and others that one of the prophets of old has risen
Then he said to them But who do you say that I am And Peter answered The Christ of God
And he strictly charged and commanded them to tell this to no one
saying The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and on the third day be raised
And he said to all If anyone would come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me
For whoever would save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it
For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits himself
For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels
But I tell you truly there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God
Now about eight days after these sayings he took with him Peter and John and James and went up on the mountain to pray
And as he was praying the appearance of his face was altered and his clothing became dazzling white
And behold two men were talking with him Moses and Elijah
who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem
Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep but when they became fully awake they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him
And as the men were parting from him Peter said to Jesus Master it is good that we are here Let us make three tents one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah not knowing what he said
As he was saying these things a cloud came and overshadowed them and they were afraid as they entered the cloud
And a voice came out of the cloud saying This is my Son my Chosen One listen to him
And when the voice had spoken Jesus was found alone And they kept silent and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen
On the next day when they had come down from the mountain a great crowd met him
And behold a man from the crowd cried out Teacher I beg you to look at my son for he is my only child
And behold a spirit seizes him and he suddenly cries out It convulses him so that he foams at the mouth and shatters him and will hardly leave him
And I begged your disciples to cast it out but they could not
Jesus answered O faithless and twisted generation how long am I to be with you and bear with you Bring your son here
While he was coming the demon threw him to the ground and convulsed him But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy and gave him back to his father
And all were astonished at the majesty of God But while they were all marveling at everything he was doing Jesus said to his disciples
Let these words sink into your ears The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men
But they did not understand this saying and it was concealed from them so that they might not perceive it And they were afraid to ask him about this saying
An argument arose among them as to which of them was the greatest
But Jesus knowing the reasoning of their hearts took a child and put him by his side
and said to them Whoever receives this child in my name receives me and whoever receives me receives him who sent me For he who is least among you all is the one who is great
John answered Master we saw someone casting out demons in your name and we tried to stop him because he does not follow with us
But Jesus said to him Do not stop him for the one who is not against you is for you
When the days drew near for him to be taken up he set his face to go to Jerusalem
And he sent messengers ahead of him who went and entered a village of the Samaritans to make preparations for him
But the people did not receive him because his face was set toward Jerusalem
And when his disciples James and John saw it they said Lord do you want us to tell fire to come down from heaven and consume them
But he turned and rebuked them
And they went on to another village
As they were going along the road someone said to him I will follow you wherever you go
And Jesus said to him Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head
To another he said Follow me But he said Lord let me first go and bury my father
And Jesus said to him Leave the dead to bury their own dead But as for you go and proclaim the kingdom of God
Yet another said I will follow you Lord but let me first say farewell to those at my home
Jesus said to him No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God
