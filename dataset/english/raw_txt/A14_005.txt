2 Chronicles 5
Thus all the work that Solomon did for the house of the LORD was finished And Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated and stored the silver the gold and all the vessels in the treasuries of the house of God
Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes the leaders of the fathers houses of the people of Israel in Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David which is Zion
And all the men of Israel assembled before the king at the feast that is in the seventh month
And all the elders of Israel came and the Levites took up the ark
And they brought up the ark the tent of meeting and all the holy vessels that were in the tent the Levitical priests brought them up
And King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel who had assembled before him were before the ark sacrificing so many sheep and oxen that they could not be counted or numbered
Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place in the inner sanctuary of the house in the Most Holy Place underneath the wings of the cherubim
The cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark so that the cherubim made a covering above the ark and its poles
And the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the Holy Place before the inner sanctuary but they could not be seen from outside And they are there to this day
There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets that Moses put there at Horeb where the LORD made a covenant with the people of Israel when they came out of Egypt
And when the priests came out of the Holy Place for all the priests who were present had consecrated themselves without regard to their divisions
and all the Levitical singers Asaph Heman and Jeduthun their sons and kinsmen arrayed in fine linen with cymbals harps and lyres stood east of the altar with priests who were trumpeters
and it was the duty of the trumpeters and singers to make themselves heard in unison in praise and thanksgiving to the LORD and when the song was raised with trumpets and cymbals and other musical instruments in praise to the LORD For he is good for his steadfast love endures forever the house the house of the LORD was filled with a cloud
so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud for the glory of the LORD filled the house of God
