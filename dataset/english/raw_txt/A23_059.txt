Isaiah 59
Behold the LORD s hand is not shortened that it cannot save or his ear dull that it cannot hear
but your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God and your sins have hidden his face from you so that he does not hear
For your hands are defiled with blood and your fingers with iniquity your lips have spoken lies your tongue mutters wickedness
No one enters suit justly no one goes to law honestly they rely on empty pleas they speak lies they conceive mischief and give birth to iniquity
They hatch adders eggs they weave the spider s web he who eats their eggs dies and from one that is crushed a viper is hatched
Their webs will not serve as clothing men will not cover themselves with what they make Their works are works of iniquity and deeds of violence are in their hands
Their feet run to evil and they are swift to shed innocent blood their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity desolation and destruction are in their highways
The way of peace they do not know and there is no justice in their paths they have made their roads crooked no one who treads on them knows peace
Therefore justice is far from us and righteousness does not overtake us we hope for light and behold darkness and for brightness but we walk in gloom
We grope for the wall like the blind we grope like those who have no eyes we stumble at noon as in the twilight among those in full vigor we are like dead men
We all growl like bears we moan and moan like doves we hope for justice but there is none for salvation but it is far from us
For our transgressions are multiplied before you and our sins testify against us for our transgressions are with us and we know our iniquities
transgressing and denying the LORD and turning back from following our God speaking oppression and revolt conceiving and uttering from the heart lying words
Justice is turned back and righteousness stands far away for truth has stumbled in the public squares and uprightness cannot enter
Truth is lacking and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey The LORD saw it and it displeased him that there was no justice
He saw that there was no man and wondered that there was no one to intercede then his own arm brought him salvation and his righteousness upheld him
He put on righteousness as a breastplate and a helmet of salvation on his head he put on garments of vengeance for clothing and wrapped himself in zeal as a cloak
According to their deeds so will he repay wrath to his adversaries repayment to his enemies to the coastlands he will render repayment
So they shall fear the name of the LORD from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun for he will come like a rushing stream which the wind of the LORD drives
And a Redeemer will come to Zion to those in Jacob who turn from transgression declares the LORD
And as for me this is my covenant with them says the LORD My Spirit that is upon you and my words that I have put in your mouth shall not depart out of your mouth or out of the mouth of your offspring or out of the mouth of your children s offspring says the LORD from this time forth and forevermore
