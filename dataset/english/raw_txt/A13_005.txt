and Bela the son of Azaz son of Shema son of Joel who lived in Aroer as far as Nebo and Baal meon
He also lived to the east as far as the entrance of the desert this side of the Euphrates because their livestock had multiplied in the land of Gilead
And in the days of Saul they waged war against the Hagrites who fell into their hand And they lived in their tents throughout all the region east of Gilead

The Reubenites the Gadites and the half tribe of Manasseh had valiant men who carried shield and sword and drew the bow expert in war able to go to war
They waged war against the Hagrites Jetur Naphish and Nodab
And when they prevailed over them the Hagrites and all who were with them were given into their hands for they cried out to God in the battle and he granted their urgent plea because they trusted in him
They carried off their livestock of their camels sheep donkeys and men alive
For many fell because the war was of God And they lived in their place until the exile
