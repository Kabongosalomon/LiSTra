Proverbs 27
Do not boast about tomorrow for you do not know what a day may bring
Let another praise you and not your own mouth a stranger and not your own lips
A stone is heavy and sand is weighty but a fool s provocation is heavier than both
Wrath is cruel anger is overwhelming but who can stand before jealousy
Better is open rebuke than hidden love
Faithful are the wounds of a friend profuse are the kisses of an enemy
One who is full loathes honey but to one who is hungry everything bitter is sweet
Like a bird that strays from its nest is a man who strays from his home
Oil and perfume make the heart glad and the sweetness of a friend comes from his earnest counsel
Do not forsake your friend and your father s friend and do not go to your brother s house in the day of your calamity Better is a neighbor who is near than a brother who is far away
Be wise my son and make my heart glad that I may answer him who reproaches me
The prudent sees danger and hides himself but the simple go on and suffer for it
Take a man s garment when he has put up security for a stranger and hold it in pledge when he puts up security for an adulteress
Whoever blesses his neighbor with a loud voice rising early in the morning will be counted as cursing
A continual dripping on a rainy day and a quarrelsome wife are alike
to restrain her is to restrain the wind or to grasp oil in one s right hand
Iron sharpens iron and one man sharpens another
Whoever tends a fig tree will eat its fruit and he who guards his master will be honored
As in water face reflects face so the heart of man reflects the man
Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied and never satisfied are the eyes of man
The crucible is for silver and the furnace is for gold and a man is tested by his praise
Crush a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with crushed grain yet his folly will not depart from him
Know well the condition of your flocks and give attention to your herds
for riches do not last forever and does a crown endure to all generations
When the grass is gone and the new growth appears and the vegetation of the mountains is gathered
the lambs will provide your clothing and the goats the price of a field
There will be enough goats milk for your food for the food of your household and maintenance for your girls
