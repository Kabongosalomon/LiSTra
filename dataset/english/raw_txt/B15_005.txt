1 Timothy 5
Do not rebuke an older man but encourage him as you would a father younger men as brothers
older women as mothers younger women as sisters in all purity
Honor widows who are truly widows
But if a widow has children or grandchildren let them first learn to show godliness to their own household and to make some return to their parents for this is pleasing in the sight of God
She who is truly a widow left all alone has set her hope on God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day
but she who is self indulgent is dead even while she lives
Command these things as well so that they may be without reproach
But if anyone does not provide for his relatives and especially for members of his household he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever
Let a widow be enrolled if she is not less than sixty years of age having been the wife of one husband
and having a reputation for good works if she has brought up children has shown hospitality has washed the feet of the saints has cared for the afflicted and has devoted herself to every good work
But refuse to enroll younger widows for when their passions draw them away from Christ they desire to marry
and so incur condemnation for having abandoned their former faith
Besides that they learn to be idlers going about from house to house and not only idlers but also gossips and busybodies saying what they should not
So I would have younger widows marry bear children manage their households and give the adversary no occasion for slander
For some have already strayed after Satan
If any believing woman has relatives who are widows let her care for them Let the church not be burdened so that it may care for those who are truly widows
Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor especially those who labor in preaching and teaching
For the Scripture says You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain and The laborer deserves his wages
Do not admit a charge against an elder except on the evidence of two or three witnesses
As for those who persist in sin rebuke them in the presence of all so that the rest may stand in fear
In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the elect angels I charge you to keep these rules without prejudging doing nothing from partiality
Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands nor take part in the sins of others keep yourself pure
No longer drink only water but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments
The sins of some men are conspicuous going before them to judgment but the sins of others appear later
So also good works are conspicuous and even those that are not cannot remain hidden
