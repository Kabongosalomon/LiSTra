Proverbs 24
Be not envious of evil men nor desire to be with them
for their hearts devise violence and their lips talk of trouble
By wisdom a house is built and by understanding it is established
by knowledge the rooms are filled with all precious and pleasant riches
A wise man is full of strength and a man of knowledge enhances his might
for by wise guidance you can wage your war and in abundance of counselors there is victory
Wisdom is too high for a fool in the gate he does not open his mouth
Whoever plans to do evil will be called a schemer
The devising of folly is sin and the scoffer is an abomination to mankind
If you faint in the day of adversity your strength is small
Rescue those who are being taken away to death hold back those who are stumbling to the slaughter
If you say Behold we did not know this does not he who weighs the heart perceive it Does not he who keeps watch over your soul know it and will he not repay man according to his work
My son eat honey for it is good and the drippings of the honeycomb are sweet to your taste
Know that wisdom is such to your soul if you find it there will be a future and your hope will not be cut off
Lie not in wait as a wicked man against the dwelling of the righteous do no violence to his home
for the righteous falls seven times and rises again but the wicked stumble in times of calamity
Do not rejoice when your enemy falls and let not your heart be glad when he stumbles
lest the LORD see it and be displeased and turn away his anger from him
Fret not yourself because of evildoers and be not envious of the wicked
for the evil man has no future the lamp of the wicked will be put out
My son fear the LORD and the king and do not join with those who do otherwise
for disaster will arise suddenly from them and who knows the ruin that will come from them both
These also are sayings of the wise Partiality in judging is not good
Whoever says to the wicked You are in the right will be cursed by peoples abhorred by nations
but those who rebuke the wicked will have delight and a good blessing will come upon them
Whoever gives an honest answer kisses the lips
Prepare your work outside get everything ready for yourself in the field and after that build your house
Be not a witness against your neighbor without cause and do not deceive with your lips
Do not say I will do to him as he has done to me I will pay the man back for what he has done
I passed by the field of a sluggard by the vineyard of a man lacking sense
and behold it was all overgrown with thorns the ground was covered with nettles and its stone wall was broken down
Then I saw and considered it I looked and received instruction
A little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to rest
and poverty will come upon you like a robber and want like an armed man
