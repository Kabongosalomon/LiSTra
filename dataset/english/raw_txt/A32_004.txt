Jonah 4
But it displeased Jonah exceedingly and he was angry
And he prayed to the LORD and said O LORD is not this what I said when I was yet in my country That is why I made haste to flee to Tarshish for I knew that you are a gracious God and merciful slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and relenting from disaster
Therefore now O LORD please take my life from me for it is better for me to die than to live
And the LORD said Do you do well to be angry
Jonah went out of the city and sat to the east of the city and made a booth for himself there He sat under it in the shade till he should see what would become of the city
Now the LORD God appointed a plant and made it come up over Jonah that it might be a shade over his head to save him from his discomfort So Jonah was exceedingly glad because of the plant
But when dawn came up the next day God appointed a worm that attacked the plant so that it withered
When the sun rose God appointed a scorching east wind and the sun beat down on the head of Jonah so that he was faint And he asked that he might die and said It is better for me to die than to live
But God said to Jonah Do you do well to be angry for the plant And he said Yes I do well to be angry angry enough to die
And the LORD said You pity the plant for which you did not labor nor did you make it grow which came into being in a night and perished in a night
And should not I pity Nineveh that great city in which there are more than persons who do not know their right hand from their left and also much cattle
