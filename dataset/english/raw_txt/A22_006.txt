Song of Solomon 6
Where has your beloved gone O most beautiful among women Where has your beloved turned that we may seek him with you SHE
My beloved has gone down to his garden to the beds of spices to graze in the gardens and to gather lilies
I am my beloved s and my beloved is mine he grazes among the lilies HE
You are beautiful as Tirzah my love lovely as Jerusalem awesome as an army with banners
Turn away your eyes from me for they overwhelm me Your hair is like a flock of goats leaping down the slopes of Gilead
Your teeth are like a flock of ewes that have come up from the washing all of them bear twins not one among them has lost its young
Your cheeks are like halves of a pomegranate behind your veil
There are sixty queens and eighty concubines and virgins without number
My dove my perfect one is the only one the only one of her mother pure to her who bore her The young women saw her and called her blessed the queens and concubines also and they praised her
Who is this who looks down like the dawn beautiful as the moon bright as the sun awesome as an army with banners SHE
I went down to the nut orchard to look at the blossoms of the valley to see whether the vines had budded whether the pomegranates were in bloom
Before I was aware my desire set me among the chariots of my kinsman a prince OTHERS
Return return O Shulammite return return that we may look upon you HE Why should you look upon the Shulammite as upon a dance before two armies
