2 Kings 2
Now when the LORD was about to take Elijah up to heaven by a whirlwind Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal
And Elijah said to Elisha Please stay here for the LORD has sent me as far as Bethel But Elisha said As the LORD lives and as you yourself live I will not leave you So they went down to Bethel
And the sons of the prophets who were in Bethel came out to Elisha and said to him Do you know that today the LORD will take away your master from over you And he said Yes I know it keep quiet
Elijah said to him Elisha please stay here for the LORD has sent me to Jericho But he said As the LORD lives and as you yourself live I will not leave you So they came to Jericho
The sons of the prophets who were at Jericho drew near to Elisha and said to him Do you know that today the LORD will take away your master from over you And he answered Yes I know it keep quiet
Then Elijah said to him Please stay here for the LORD has sent me to the Jordan But he said As the LORD lives and as you yourself live I will not leave you So the two of them went on
Fifty men of the sons of the prophets also went and stood at some distance from them as they both were standing by the Jordan
Then Elijah took his cloak and rolled it up and struck the water and the water was parted to the one side and to the other till the two of them could go over on dry ground
When they had crossed Elijah said to Elisha Ask what I shall do for you before I am taken from you And Elisha said Please let there be a double portion of your spirit on me
And he said You have asked a hard thing yet if you see me as I am being taken from you it shall be so for you but if you do not see me it shall not be so
And as they still went on and talked behold chariots of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven
And Elisha saw it and he cried My father my father The chariots of Israel and its horsemen And he saw him no more Then he took hold of his own clothes and tore them in two pieces
And he took up the cloak of Elijah that had fallen from him and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan
Then he took the cloak of Elijah that had fallen from him and struck the water saying Where is the LORD the God of Elijah And when he had struck the water the water was parted to the one side and to the other and Elisha went over
Now when the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho saw him opposite them they said The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha And they came to meet him and bowed to the ground before him
And they said to him Behold now there are with your servants fifty strong men Please let them go and seek your master It may be that the Spirit of the LORD has caught him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley And he said You shall not send
But when they urged him till he was ashamed he said Send They sent therefore fifty men And for three days they sought him but did not find him
And they came back to him while he was staying at Jericho and he said to them Did I not say to you Do not go
Now the men of the city said to Elisha Behold the situation of this city is pleasant as my lord sees but the water is bad and the land is unfruitful
He said Bring me a new bowl and put salt in it So they brought it to him
Then he went to the spring of water and threw salt in it and said Thus says the LORD I have healed this water from now on neither death nor miscarriage shall come from it
So the water has been healed to this day according to the word that Elisha spoke
He went up from there to Bethel and while he was going up on the way some small boys came out of the city and jeered at him saying Go up you baldhead Go up you baldhead
And he turned around and when he saw them he cursed them in the name of the LORD And two she bears came out of the woods and tore forty two of the boys
From there he went on to Mount Carmel and from there he returned to Samaria
