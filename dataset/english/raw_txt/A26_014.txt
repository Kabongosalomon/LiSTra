Ezekiel 14
Then certain of the elders of Israel came to me and sat before me
And the word of the LORD came to me
Son of man these men have taken their idols into their hearts and set the stumbling block of their iniquity before their faces Should I indeed let myself be consulted by them
Therefore speak to them and say to them Thus says the Lord GOD Any one of the house of Israel who takes his idols into his heart and sets the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face and yet comes to the prophet I the LORD will answer him as he comes with the multitude of his idols
that I may lay hold of the hearts of the house of Israel who are all estranged from me through their idols
Therefore say to the house of Israel Thus says the Lord GOD Repent and turn away from your idols and turn away your faces from all your abominations
For any one of the house of Israel or of the strangers who sojourn in Israel who separates himself from me taking his idols into his heart and putting the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face and yet comes to a prophet to consult me through him I the LORD will answer him myself
And I will set my face against that man I will make him a sign and a byword and cut him off from the midst of my people and you shall know that I am the LORD
And if the prophet is deceived and speaks a word I the LORD have deceived that prophet and I will stretch out my hand against him and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel
And they shall bear their punishment the punishment of the prophet and the punishment of the inquirer shall be alike
that the house of Israel may no more go astray from me nor defile themselves anymore with all their transgressions but that they may be my people and I may be their God declares the Lord GOD
And the word of the LORD came to me
Son of man when a land sins against me by acting faithlessly and I stretch out my hand against it and break its supply of bread and send famine upon it and cut off from it man and beast
even if these three men Noah Daniel and Job were in it they would deliver but their own lives by their righteousness declares the Lord GOD
If I cause wild beasts to pass through the land and they ravage it and it be made desolate so that no one may pass through because of the beasts
even if these three men were in it as I live declares the Lord GOD they would deliver neither sons nor daughters They alone would be delivered but the land would be desolate
Or if I bring a sword upon that land and say Let a sword pass through the land and I cut off from it man and beast
though these three men were in it as I live declares the Lord GOD they would deliver neither sons nor daughters but they alone would be delivered
Or if I send a pestilence into that land and pour out my wrath upon it with blood to cut off from it man and beast
even if Noah Daniel and Job were in it as I live declares the Lord GOD they would deliver neither son nor daughter They would deliver but their own lives by their righteousness
For thus says the Lord GOD How much more when I send upon Jerusalem my four disastrous acts of judgment sword famine wild beasts and pestilence to cut off from it man and beast
But behold some survivors will be left in it sons and daughters who will be brought out behold when they come out to you and you see their ways and their deeds you will be consoled for the disaster that I have brought upon Jerusalem for all that I have brought upon it
They will console you when you see their ways and their deeds and you shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it declares the Lord GOD
