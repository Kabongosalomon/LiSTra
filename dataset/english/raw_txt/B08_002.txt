2 Corienthians 2
For I made up my mind not to make another painful visit to you
For if I cause you pain who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have pained
And I wrote as I did so that when I came I might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice for I felt sure of all of you that my joy would be the joy of you all
For I wrote to you out of much affliction and anguish of heart and with many tears not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you
Now if anyone has caused pain he has caused it not to me but in some measure not to put it too severely to all of you
For such a one this punishment by the majority is enough
so you should rather turn to forgive and comfort him or he may be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow
So I beg you to reaffirm your love for him
For this is why I wrote that I might test you and know whether you are obedient in everything
Anyone whom you forgive I also forgive Indeed what I have forgiven if I have forgiven anything has been for your sake in the presence of Christ
so that we would not be outwitted by Satan for we are not ignorant of his designs
When I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ even though a door was opened for me in the Lord
my spirit was not at rest because I did not find my brother Titus there So I took leave of them and went on to Macedonia
But thanks be to God who in Christ always leads us in triumphal procession and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere
For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing
to one a fragrance from death to death to the other a fragrance from life to life Who is sufficient for these things
For we are not like so many peddlers of God s word but as men of sincerity as commissioned by God in the sight of God we speak in Christ
