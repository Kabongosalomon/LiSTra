Numbers 9
And the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt saying
Let the people of Israel keep the Passover at its appointed time
On the fourteenth day of this month at twilight you shall keep it at its appointed time according to all its statutes and all its rules you shall keep it
So Moses told the people of Israel that they should keep the Passover
And they kept the Passover in the first month on the fourteenth day of the month at twilight in the wilderness of Sinai according to all that the LORD commanded Moses so the people of Israel did
And there were certain men who were unclean through touching a dead body so that they could not keep the Passover on that day and they came before Moses and Aaron on that day
And those men said to him We are unclean through touching a dead body Why are we kept from bringing the LORD s offering at its appointed time among the people of Israel
And Moses said to them Wait that I may hear what the LORD will command concerning you
The LORD spoke to Moses saying
Speak to the people of Israel saying If any one of you or of your descendants is unclean through touching a dead body or is on a long journey he shall still keep the Passover to the LORD
In the second month on the fourteenth day at twilight they shall keep it They shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs
They shall leave none of it until the morning nor break any of its bones according to all the statute for the Passover they shall keep it
But if anyone who is clean and is not on a journey fails to keep the Passover that person shall be cut off from his people because he did not bring the LORD s offering at its appointed time that man shall bear his sin
And if a stranger sojourns among you and would keep the Passover to the LORD according to the statute of the Passover and according to its rule so shall he do You shall have one statute both for the sojourner and for the native
On the day that the tabernacle was set up the cloud covered the tabernacle the tent of the testimony And at evening it was over the tabernacle like the appearance of fire until morning
So it was always the cloud covered it by day and the appearance of fire by night
And whenever the cloud lifted from over the tent after that the people of Israel set out and in the place where the cloud settled down there the people of Israel camped
At the command of the LORD the people of Israel set out and at the command of the LORD they camped As long as the cloud rested over the tabernacle they remained in camp
Even when the cloud continued over the tabernacle many days the people of Israel kept the charge of the LORD and did not set out
Sometimes the cloud was a few days over the tabernacle and according to the command of the LORD they remained in camp then according to the command of the LORD they set out
And sometimes the cloud remained from evening until morning And when the cloud lifted in the morning they set out or if it continued for a day and a night when the cloud lifted they set out
Whether it was two days or a month or a longer time that the cloud continued over the tabernacle abiding there the people of Israel remained in camp and did not set out but when it lifted they set out
At the command of the LORD they camped and at the command of the LORD they set out They kept the charge of the LORD at the command of the LORD by Moses
