Haggai 1
In the second year of Darius the king in the sixth month on the first day of the month the word of the LORD came by the hand of Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel governor of Judah and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak the high priest
Thus says the LORD of hosts These people say the time has not yet come to rebuild the house of the LORD
Then the word of the LORD came by the hand of Haggai the prophet
Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses while this house lies in ruins
Now therefore thus says the LORD of hosts Consider your ways
You have sown much and harvested little You eat but you never have enough you drink but you never have your fill You clothe yourselves but no one is warm And he who earns wages does so to put them into a bag with holes
Thus says the LORD of hosts Consider your ways
Go up to the hills and bring wood and build the house that I may take pleasure in it and that I may be glorified says the LORD
You looked for much and behold it came to little And when you brought it home I blew it away Why declares the LORD of hosts Because of my house that lies in ruins while each of you busies himself with his own house
Therefore the heavens above you have withheld the dew and the earth has withheld its produce
And I have called for a drought on the land and the hills on the grain the new wine the oil on what the ground brings forth on man and beast and on all their labors
Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Joshua the son of Jehozadak the high priest with all the remnant of the people obeyed the voice of the LORD their God and the words of Haggai the prophet as the LORD their God had sent him And the people feared the LORD
Then Haggai the messenger of the LORD spoke to the people with the LORD s message I am with you declares the LORD
And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel governor of Judah and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak the high priest and the spirit of all the remnant of the people And they came and worked on the house of the LORD of hosts their God
on the twenty fourth day of the month in the sixth month in the second year of Darius the king
