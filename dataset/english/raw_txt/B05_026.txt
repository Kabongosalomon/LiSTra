Acts 26
So Agrippa said to Paul You have permission to speak for yourself Then Paul stretched out his hand and made his defense
I consider myself fortunate that it is before you King Agrippa I am going to make my defense today against all the accusations of the Jews
especially because you are familiar with all the customs and controversies of the Jews Therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently
My manner of life from my youth spent from the beginning among my own nation and in Jerusalem is known by all the Jews
They have known for a long time if they are willing to testify that according to the strictest party of our religion I have lived as a Pharisee
And now I stand here on trial because of my hope in the promise made by God to our fathers
to which our twelve tribes hope to attain as they earnestly worship night and day And for this hope I am accused by Jews O king
Why is it thought incredible by any of you that God raises the dead
I myself was convinced that I ought to do many things in opposing the name of Jesus of Nazareth
And I did so in Jerusalem I not only locked up many of the saints in prison after receiving authority from the chief priests but when they were put to death I cast my vote against them
And I punished them often in all the synagogues and tried to make them blaspheme and in raging fury against them I persecuted them even to foreign cities
In this connection I journeyed to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests
At midday O king I saw on the way a light from heaven brighter than the sun that shone around me and those who journeyed with me
And when we had all fallen to the ground I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language Saul Saul why are you persecuting me It is hard for you to kick against the goads
And I said Who are you Lord And the Lord said I am Jesus whom you are persecuting
But rise and stand upon your feet for I have appeared to you for this purpose to appoint you as a servant and witness to the things in which you have seen me and to those in which I will appear to you
delivering you from your people and from the Gentiles to whom I am sending you
to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me
Therefore O King Agrippa I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision
but declared first to those in Damascus then in Jerusalem and throughout all the region of Judea and also to the Gentiles that they should repent and turn to God performing deeds in keeping with their repentance
For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me
To this day I have had the help that comes from God and so I stand here testifying both to small and great saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would come to pass
that the Christ must suffer and that by being the first to rise from the dead he would proclaim light both to our people and to the Gentiles
And as he was saying these things in his defense Festus said with a loud voice Paul you are out of your mind your great learning is driving you out of your mind
But Paul said I am not out of my mind most excellent Festus but I am speaking true and rational words
For the king knows about these things and to him I speak boldly For I am persuaded that none of these things has escaped his notice for this has not been done in a corner
King Agrippa do you believe the prophets I know that you believe
And Agrippa said to Paul In a short time would you persuade me to be a Christian
And Paul said Whether short or long I would to God that not only you but also all who hear me this day might become such as I am except for these chains
Then the king rose and the governor and Bernice and those who were sitting with them
And when they had withdrawn they said to one another This man is doing nothing to deserve death or imprisonment
And Agrippa said to Festus This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar
