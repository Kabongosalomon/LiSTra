Ezekiel 34
The word of the LORD came to me
Son of man prophesy against the shepherds of Israel prophesy and say to them even to the shepherds Thus says the Lord GOD Ah shepherds of Israel who have been feeding yourselves Should not shepherds feed the sheep
You eat the fat you clothe yourselves with the wool you slaughter the fat ones but you do not feed the sheep
The weak you have not strengthened the sick you have not healed the injured you have not bound up the strayed you have not brought back the lost you have not sought and with force and harshness you have ruled them
So they were scattered because there was no shepherd and they became food for all the wild beasts
My sheep were scattered they wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill My sheep were scattered over all the face of the earth with none to search or seek for them
Therefore you shepherds hear the word of the LORD
As I live declares the Lord GOD surely because my sheep have become a prey and my sheep have become food for all the wild beasts since there was no shepherd and because my shepherds have not searched for my sheep but the shepherds have fed themselves and have not fed my sheep
therefore you shepherds hear the word of the LORD
Thus says the Lord GOD Behold I am against the shepherds and I will require my sheep at their hand and put a stop to their feeding the sheep No longer shall the shepherds feed themselves I will rescue my sheep from their mouths that they may not be food for them
For thus says the Lord GOD Behold I I myself will search for my sheep and will seek them out
As a shepherd seeks out his flock when he is among his sheep that have been scattered so will I seek out my sheep and I will rescue them from all places where they have been scattered on a day of clouds and thick darkness
And I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries and will bring them into their own land And I will feed them on the mountains of Israel by the ravines and in all the inhabited places of the country
I will feed them with good pasture and on the mountain heights of Israel shall be their grazing land There they shall lie down in good grazing land and on rich pasture they shall feed on the mountains of Israel
I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep and I myself will make them lie down declares the Lord GOD
I will seek the lost and I will bring back the strayed and I will bind up the injured and I will strengthen the weak and the fat and the strong I will destroy I will feed them in justice
As for you my flock thus says the Lord GOD Behold I judge between sheep and sheep between rams and male goats
Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture that you must tread down with your feet the rest of your pasture and to drink of clear water that you must muddy the rest of the water with your feet
And must my sheep eat what you have trodden with your feet and drink what you have muddied with your feet
Therefore thus says the Lord GOD to them Behold I I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep
Because you push with side and shoulder and thrust at all the weak with your horns till you have scattered them abroad
I will rescue my flock they shall no longer be a prey And I will judge between sheep and sheep
And I will set up over them one shepherd my servant David and he shall feed them he shall feed them and be their shepherd
And I the LORD will be their God and my servant David shall be prince among them I am the LORD I have spoken
I will make with them a covenant of peace and banish wild beasts from the land so that they may dwell securely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods
And I will make them and the places all around my hill a blessing and I will send down the showers in their season they shall be showers of blessing
And the trees of the field shall yield their fruit and the earth shall yield its increase and they shall be secure in their land And they shall know that I am the LORD when I break the bars of their yoke and deliver them from the hand of those who enslaved them
They shall no more be a prey to the nations nor shall the beasts of the land devour them They shall dwell securely and none shall make them afraid
And I will provide for them renowned plantations so that they shall no more be consumed with hunger in the land and no longer suffer the reproach of the nations
And they shall know that I am the LORD their God with them and that they the house of Israel are my people declares the Lord GOD
And you are my sheep human sheep of my pasture and I am your God declares the Lord GOD
