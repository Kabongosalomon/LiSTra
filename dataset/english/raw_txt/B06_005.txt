Romans 5
Therefore since we have been justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ
Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God
More than that we rejoice in our sufferings knowing that suffering produces endurance
and endurance produces character and character produces hope
and hope does not put us to shame because God s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us
For while we were still weak at the right time Christ died for the ungodly
For one will scarcely die for a righteous person though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die
but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners Christ died for us
Since therefore we have now been justified by his blood much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God
For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son much more now that we are reconciled shall we be saved by his life
More than that we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ through whom we have now received reconciliation
Therefore just as sin came into the world through one man and death through sin and so death spread to all men because all sinned
for sin indeed was in the world before the law was given but sin is not counted where there is no law
Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses even over those whose sinning was not like the transgression of Adam who was a type of the one who was to come
But the free gift is not like the trespass For if many died through one man s trespass much more have the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of that one man Jesus Christ abounded for many
And the free gift is not like the result of that one man s sin For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation but the free gift following many trespasses brought justification
For if because of one man s trespass death reigned through that one man much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ
Therefore as one trespass led to condemnation for all men so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men
For as by the one man s disobedience the many were made sinners so by the one man s obedience the many will be made righteous
Now the law came in to increase the trespass but where sin increased grace abounded all the more
so that as sin reigned in death grace also might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord
