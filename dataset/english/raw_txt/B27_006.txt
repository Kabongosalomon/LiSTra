Revelation 6
Now I watched when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals and I heard one of the four living creatures say with a voice like thunder Come
And I looked and behold a white horse And its rider had a bow and a crown was given to him and he came out conquering and to conquer
When he opened the second seal I heard the second living creature say Come
And out came another horse bright red Its rider was permitted to take peace from the earth so that people should slay one another and he was given a great sword
When he opened the third seal I heard the third living creature say Come And I looked and behold a black horse And its rider had a pair of scales in his hand
And I heard what seemed to be a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying A quart of wheat for a denarius and three quarts of barley for a denarius and do not harm the oil and wine
When he opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say Come
And I looked and behold a pale horse And its rider s name was Death and Hades followed him And they were given authority over a fourth of the earth to kill with sword and with famine and with pestilence and by wild beasts of the earth
When he opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the witness they had borne
They cried out with a loud voice O Sovereign Lord holy and true how long before you will judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth
Then they were each given a white robe and told to rest a little longer until the number of their fellow servants and their brothers should be complete who were to be killed as they themselves had been
When he opened the sixth seal I looked and behold there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth the full moon became like blood
and the stars of the sky fell to the earth as the fig tree sheds its winter fruit when shaken by a gale
The sky vanished like a scroll that is being rolled up and every mountain and island was removed from its place
Then the kings of the earth and the great ones and the generals and the rich and the powerful and everyone slave and free hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains
calling to the mountains and rocks Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who is seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb
for the great day of their wrath has come and who can stand
