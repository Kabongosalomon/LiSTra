1 Samuel 3
Now the young man Samuel was ministering to the LORD under Eli And the word of the LORD was rare in those days there was no frequent vision
At that time Eli whose eyesight had begun to grow dim so that he could not see was lying down in his own place
The lamp of God had not yet gone out and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the LORD where the ark of God was
Then the LORD called Samuel and he said Here I am
and ran to Eli and said Here I am for you called me But he said I did not call lie down again So he went and lay down
And the LORD called again Samuel and Samuel arose and went to Eli and said Here I am for you called me But he said I did not call my son lie down again
Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD and the word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him
And the LORD called Samuel again the third time And he arose and went to Eli and said Here I am for you called me Then Eli perceived that the LORD was calling the young man
Therefore Eli said to Samuel Go lie down and if he calls you you shall say Speak LORD for your servant hears So Samuel went and lay down in his place
And the LORD came and stood calling as at other times Samuel Samuel And Samuel said Speak for your servant hears
Then the LORD said to Samuel Behold I am about to do a thing in Israel at which the two ears of everyone who hears it will tingle
On that day I will fulfill against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house from beginning to end
And I declare to him that I am about to punish his house forever for the iniquity that he knew because his sons were blaspheming God and he did not restrain them
Therefore I swear to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli s house shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering forever
Samuel lay until morning then he opened the doors of the house of the LORD And Samuel was afraid to tell the vision to Eli
But Eli called Samuel and said Samuel my son And he said Here I am
And Eli said What was it that he told you Do not hide it from me May God do so to you and more also if you hide anything from me of all that he told you
So Samuel told him everything and hid nothing from him And he said It is the LORD Let him do what seems good to him
And Samuel grew and the LORD was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground
And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established as a prophet of the LORD
And the LORD appeared again at Shiloh for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of the LORD
