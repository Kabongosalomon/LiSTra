Deuteronomy 3
Then we turned and went up the way to Bashan And Og the king of Bashan came out against us he and all his people to battle at Edrei
But the LORD said to me Do not fear him for I have given him and all his people and his land into your hand And you shall do to him as you did to Sihon the king of the Amorites who lived at Heshbon
So the LORD our God gave into our hand Og also the king of Bashan and all his people and we struck him down until he had no survivor left
And we took all his cities at that time there was not a city that we did not take from them sixty cities the whole region of Argob the kingdom of Og in Bashan
All these were cities fortified with high walls gates and bars besides very many unwalled villages
And we devoted them to destruction as we did to Sihon the king of Heshbon devoting to destruction every city men women and children
But all the livestock and the spoil of the cities we took as our plunder
So we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan from the Valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon
the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion while the Amorites call it Senir
all the cities of the tableland and all Gilead and all Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan
For only Og the king of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Rephaim Behold his bed was a bed of iron Is it not in Rabbah of the Ammonites Nine cubits was its length and four cubits its breadth according to the common cubit
When we took possession of this land at that time I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites the territory beginning at Aroer which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon and half the hill country of Gilead with its cities
The rest of Gilead and all Bashan the kingdom of Og that is all the region of Argob I gave to the half tribe of Manasseh All that portion of Bashan is called the land of Rephaim
Jair the Manassite took all the region of Argob that is Bashan as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites and called the villages after his own name Havvoth jair as it is to this day
To Machir I gave Gilead
and to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory from Gilead as far as the Valley of the Arnon with the middle of the valley as a border as far over as the river Jabbok the border of the Ammonites
the Arabah also with the Jordan as the border from Chinnereth as far as the Sea of the Arabah the Salt Sea under the slopes of Pisgah on the east
And I commanded you at that time saying The LORD your God has given you this land to possess All your men of valor shall cross over armed before your brothers the people of Israel
Only your wives your little ones and your livestock I know that you have much livestock shall remain in the cities that I have given you
until the LORD gives rest to your brothers as to you and they also occupy the land that the LORD your God gives them beyond the Jordan Then each of you may return to his possession which I have given you
And I commanded Joshua at that time Your eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings So will the LORD do to all the kingdoms into which you are crossing
You shall not fear them for it is the LORD your God who fights for you
And I pleaded with the LORD at that time saying
O Lord GOD you have only begun to show your servant your greatness and your mighty hand For what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do such works and mighty acts as yours
Please let me go over and see the good land beyond the Jordan that good hill country and Lebanon
But the LORD was angry with me because of you and would not listen to me And the LORD said to me Enough from you do not speak to me of this matter again
Go up to the top of Pisgah and lift up your eyes westward and northward and southward and eastward and look at it with your eyes for you shall not go over this Jordan
But charge Joshua and encourage and strengthen him for he shall go over at the head of this people and he shall put them in possession of the land that you shall see
So we remained in the valley opposite Beth peor
