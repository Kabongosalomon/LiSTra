Joshua 18
Then the whole congregation of the people of Israel assembled at Shiloh and set up the tent of meeting there The land lay subdued before them
There remained among the people of Israel seven tribes whose inheritance had not yet been apportioned
So Joshua said to the people of Israel How long will you put off going in to take possession of the land which the LORD the God of your fathers has given you
Provide three men from each tribe and I will send them out that they may set out and go up and down the land They shall write a description of it with a view to their inheritances and then come to me
They shall divide it into seven portions Judah shall continue in his territory on the south and the house of Joseph shall continue in their territory on the north
And you shall describe the land in seven divisions and bring the description here to me And I will cast lots for you here before the LORD our God
The Levites have no portion among you for the priesthood of the LORD is their heritage And Gad and Reuben and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan eastward which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them
So the men arose and went and Joshua charged those who went to write the description of the land saying Go up and down in the land and write a description and return to me And I will cast lots for you here before the LORD in Shiloh
So the men went and passed up and down in the land and wrote in a book a description of it by towns in seven divisions Then they came to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh
and Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD And there Joshua apportioned the land to the people of Israel to each his portion
