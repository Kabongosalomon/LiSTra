Job 13
Behold my eye has seen all this my ear has heard and understood it
What you know I also know I am not inferior to you
But I would speak to the Almighty and I desire to argue my case with God
As for you you whitewash with lies worthless physicians are you all
Oh that you would keep silent and it would be your wisdom
Hear now my argument and listen to the pleadings of my lips
Will you speak falsely for God and speak deceitfully for him
Will you show partiality toward him Will you plead the case for God
Will it be well with you when he searches you out Or can you deceive him as one deceives a man
He will surely rebuke you if in secret you show partiality
Will not his majesty terrify you and the dread of him fall upon you
Your maxims are proverbs of ashes your defenses are defenses of clay
Let me have silence and I will speak and let come on me what may
Why should I take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in my hand
Though he slay me I will hope in him yet I will argue my ways to his face
This will be my salvation that the godless shall not come before him
Keep listening to my words and let my declaration be in your ears
Behold I have prepared my case I know that I shall be in the right
Who is there who will contend with me For then I would be silent and die
Only grant me two things then I will not hide myself from your face
withdraw your hand far from me and let not dread of you terrify me
Then call and I will answer or let me speak and you reply to me
How many are my iniquities and my sins Make me know my transgression and my sin
Why do you hide your face and count me as your enemy
Will you frighten a driven leaf and pursue dry chaff
For you write bitter things against me and make me inherit the iniquities of my youth
You put my feet in the stocks and watch all my paths you set a limit for the soles of my feet
Man wastes away like a rotten thing like a garment that is moth eaten
