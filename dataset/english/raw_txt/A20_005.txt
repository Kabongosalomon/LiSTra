Proverbs 5
My son be attentive to my wisdom incline your ear to my understanding
that you may keep discretion and your lips may guard knowledge
For the lips of a forbidden woman drip honey and her speech is smoother than oil
but in the end she is bitter as wormwood sharp as a two edged sword
Her feet go down to death her steps follow the path to Sheol
she does not ponder the path of life her ways wander and she does not know it
And now O sons listen to me and do not depart from the words of my mouth
Keep your way far from her and do not go near the door of her house
lest you give your honor to others and your years to the merciless
lest strangers take their fill of your strength and your labors go to the house of a foreigner
and at the end of your life you groan when your flesh and body are consumed
and you say How I hated discipline and my heart despised reproof
I did not listen to the voice of my teachers or incline my ear to my instructors
I am at the brink of utter ruin in the assembled congregation
Drink water from your own cistern flowing water from your own well
Should your springs be scattered abroad streams of water in the streets
Let them be for yourself alone and not for strangers with you
Let your fountain be blessed and rejoice in the wife of your youth
a lovely deer a graceful doe Let her breasts fill you at all times with delight be intoxicated always in her love
Why should you be intoxicated my son with a forbidden woman and embrace the bosom of an adulteress
For a man s ways are before the eyes of the LORD and he ponders all his paths
The iniquities of the wicked ensnare him and he is held fast in the cords of his sin
He dies for lack of discipline and because of his great folly he is led astray
