1 Chronicles 23
When David was old and full of days he made Solomon his son king over Israel
David assembled all the leaders of Israel and the priests and the Levites
The Levites thirty years old and upward were numbered and the total was men
Twenty four thousand of these David said shall have charge of the work in the house of the LORD shall be officers and judges
gatekeepers and shall offer praises to the LORD with the instruments that I have made for praise
And David organized them in divisions corresponding to the sons of Levi Gershon Kohath and Merari
The sons of Gershon were Ladan and Shimei
The sons of Ladan Jehiel the chief and Zetham and Joel three
The sons of Shimei Shelomoth Haziel and Haran three These were the heads of the fathers houses of Ladan
And the sons of Shimei Jahath Zina and Jeush and Beriah These four were the sons of Shimei
Jahath was the chief and Zizah the second but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons therefore they became counted as a single father s house
The sons of Kohath Amram Izhar Hebron and Uzziel four
The sons of Amram Aaron and Moses Aaron was set apart to dedicate the most holy things that he and his sons forever should make offerings before the LORD and minister to him and pronounce blessings in his name forever
But the sons of Moses the man of God were named among the tribe of Levi
The sons of Moses Gershom and Eliezer
The sons of Gershom Shebuel the chief
The sons of Eliezer Rehabiah the chief Eliezer had no other sons but the sons of Rehabiah were very many
The sons of Izhar Shelomith the chief
The sons of Hebron Jeriah the chief Amariah the second Jahaziel the third and Jekameam the fourth
The sons of Uzziel Micah the chief and Isshiah the second
The sons of Merari Mahli and Mushi The sons of Mahli Eleazar and Kish
Eleazar died having no sons but only daughters their kinsmen the sons of Kish married them
The sons of Mushi Mahli Eder and Jeremoth three
These were the sons of Levi by their fathers houses the heads of fathers houses as they were listed according to the number of the names of the individuals from twenty years old and upward who were to do the work for the service of the house of the LORD
For David said The LORD the God of Israel has given rest to his people and he dwells in Jerusalem forever
And so the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the things for its service
For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were numbered from twenty years old and upward
For their duty was to assist the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD having the care of the courts and the chambers the cleansing of all that is holy and any work for the service of the house of God
Their duty was also to assist with the showbread the flour for the grain offering the wafers of unleavened bread the baked offering the offering mixed with oil and all measures of quantity or size
And they were to stand every morning thanking and praising the LORD and likewise at evening
and whenever burnt offerings were offered to the LORD on Sabbaths new moons and feast days according to the number required of them regularly before the LORD
Thus they were to keep charge of the tent of meeting and the sanctuary and to attend the sons of Aaron their brothers for the service of the house of the LORD
