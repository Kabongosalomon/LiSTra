Matthew 1
The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham
Abraham was the father of Isaac and Isaac the father of Jacob and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers
and Judah the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar and Perez the father of Hezron and Hezron the father of Ram
and Ram the father of Amminadab and Amminadab the father of Nahshon and Nahshon the father of Salmon
and Salmon the father of Boaz by Rahab and Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth and Obed the father of Jesse
and Jesse the father of David the king And David was the father of Solomon by the wife of Uriah
and Solomon the father of Rehoboam and Rehoboam the father of Abijah and Abijah the father of Asaph
and Asaph the father of Jehoshaphat and Jehoshaphat the father of Joram and Joram the father of Uzziah
and Uzziah the father of Jotham and Jotham the father of Ahaz and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah
and Hezekiah the father of Manasseh and Manasseh the father of Amos and Amos the father of Josiah
and Josiah the father of Jechoniah and his brothers at the time of the deportation to Babylon
And after the deportation to Babylon Jechoniah was the father of Shealtiel and Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel
and Zerubbabel the father of Abiud and Abiud the father of Eliakim and Eliakim the father of Azor
and Azor the father of Zadok and Zadok the father of Achim and Achim the father of Eliud
and Eliud the father of Eleazar and Eleazar the father of Matthan and Matthan the father of Jacob
and Jacob the father of Joseph the husband of Mary of whom Jesus was born who is called Christ
So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations and from David to the deportation to Babylon fourteen generations and from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations
Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit
And her husband Joseph being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame resolved to divorce her quietly
But as he considered these things behold an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream saying Joseph son of David do not fear to take Mary as your wife for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit
She will bear a son and you shall call his name Jesus for he will save his people from their sins
All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet
Behold the virgin shall conceive and bear a son and they shall call his name Immanuel which means God with us
When Joseph woke from sleep he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him he took his wife
but knew her not until she had given birth to a son And he called his name Jesus
