Leviticus 13
The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron saying
When a person has on the skin of his body a swelling or an eruption or a spot and it turns into a case of leprous disease on the skin of his body then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons the priests
and the priest shall examine the diseased area on the skin of his body And if the hair in the diseased area has turned white and the disease appears to be deeper than the skin of his body it is a case of leprous disease When the priest has examined him he shall pronounce him unclean
But if the spot is white in the skin of his body and appears no deeper than the skin and the hair in it has not turned white the priest shall shut up the diseased person for seven days
And the priest shall examine him on the seventh day and if in his eyes the disease is checked and the disease has not spread in the skin then the priest shall shut him up for another seven days
And the priest shall examine him again on the seventh day and if the diseased area has faded and the disease has not spread in the skin then the priest shall pronounce him clean it is only an eruption And he shall wash his clothes and be clean
But if the eruption spreads in the skin after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing he shall appear again before the priest
And the priest shall look and if the eruption has spread in the skin then the priest shall pronounce him unclean it is a leprous disease
When a man is afflicted with a leprous disease he shall be brought to the priest
and the priest shall look And if there is a white swelling in the skin that has turned the hair white and there is raw flesh in the swelling
it is a chronic leprous disease in the skin of his body and the priest shall pronounce him unclean He shall not shut him up for he is unclean
And if the leprous disease breaks out in the skin so that the leprous disease covers all the skin of the diseased person from head to foot so far as the priest can see
then the priest shall look and if the leprous disease has covered all his body he shall pronounce him clean of the disease it has all turned white and he is clean
But when raw flesh appears on him he shall be unclean
And the priest shall examine the raw flesh and pronounce him unclean Raw flesh is unclean for it is a leprous disease
But if the raw flesh recovers and turns white again then he shall come to the priest
and the priest shall examine him and if the disease has turned white then the priest shall pronounce the diseased person clean he is clean
If there is in the skin of one s body a boil and it heals
and in the place of the boil there comes a white swelling or a reddish white spot then it shall be shown to the priest
And the priest shall look and if it appears deeper than the skin and its hair has turned white then the priest shall pronounce him unclean It is a case of leprous disease that has broken out in the boil
But if the priest examines it and there is no white hair in it and it is not deeper than the skin but has faded then the priest shall shut him up seven days
And if it spreads in the skin then the priest shall pronounce him unclean it is a disease
But if the spot remains in one place and does not spread it is the scar of the boil and the priest shall pronounce him clean
Or when the body has a burn on its skin and the raw flesh of the burn becomes a spot reddish white or white
the priest shall examine it and if the hair in the spot has turned white and it appears deeper than the skin then it is a leprous disease It has broken out in the burn and the priest shall pronounce him unclean it is a case of leprous disease
But if the priest examines it and there is no white hair in the spot and it is no deeper than the skin but has faded the priest shall shut him up seven days
and the priest shall examine him the seventh day If it is spreading in the skin then the priest shall pronounce him unclean it is a case of leprous disease
But if the spot remains in one place and does not spread in the skin but has faded it is a swelling from the burn and the priest shall pronounce him clean for it is the scar of the burn
When a man or woman has a disease on the head or the beard
the priest shall examine the disease And if it appears deeper than the skin and the hair in it is yellow and thin then the priest shall pronounce him unclean It is an itch a leprous disease of the head or the beard
And if the priest examines the itching disease and it appears no deeper than the skin and there is no black hair in it then the priest shall shut up the person with the itching disease for seven days
and on the seventh day the priest shall examine the disease If the itch has not spread and there is in it no yellow hair and the itch appears to be no deeper than the skin
then he shall shave himself but the itch he shall not shave and the priest shall shut up the person with the itching disease for another seven days
And on the seventh day the priest shall examine the itch and if the itch has not spread in the skin and it appears to be no deeper than the skin then the priest shall pronounce him clean And he shall wash his clothes and be clean
But if the itch spreads in the skin after his cleansing
then the priest shall examine him and if the itch has spread in the skin the priest need not seek for the yellow hair he is unclean
But if in his eyes the itch is unchanged and black hair has grown in it the itch is healed and he is clean and the priest shall pronounce him clean
When a man or a woman has spots on the skin of the body white spots
the priest shall look and if the spots on the skin of the body are of a dull white it is leukoderma that has broken out in the skin he is clean
If a man s hair falls out from his head he is bald he is clean
And if a man s hair falls out from his forehead he has baldness of the forehead he is clean
But if there is on the bald head or the bald forehead a reddish white diseased area it is a leprous disease breaking out on his bald head or his bald forehead
Then the priest shall examine him and if the diseased swelling is reddish white on his bald head or on his bald forehead like the appearance of leprous disease in the skin of the body
he is a leprous man he is unclean The priest must pronounce him unclean his disease is on his head
The leprous person who has the disease shall wear torn clothes and let the hair of his head hang loose and he shall cover his upper lip and cry out Unclean unclean
He shall remain unclean as long as he has the disease He is unclean He shall live alone His dwelling shall be outside the camp
When there is a case of leprous disease in a garment whether a woolen or a linen garment
in warp or woof of linen or wool or in a skin or in anything made of skin
if the disease is greenish or reddish in the garment or in the skin or in the warp or the woof or in any article made of skin it is a case of leprous disease and it shall be shown to the priest
And the priest shall examine the disease and shut up that which has the disease for seven days
Then he shall examine the disease on the seventh day If the disease has spread in the garment in the warp or the woof or in the skin whatever be the use of the skin the disease is a persistent leprous disease it is unclean
And he shall burn the garment or the warp or the woof the wool or the linen or any article made of skin that is diseased for it is a persistent leprous disease It shall be burned in the fire
And if the priest examines and if the disease has not spread in the garment in the warp or the woof or in any article made of skin
then the priest shall command that they wash the thing in which is the disease and he shall shut it up for another seven days
And the priest shall examine the diseased thing after it has been washed And if the appearance of the diseased area has not changed though the disease has not spread it is unclean You shall burn it in the fire whether the rot is on the back or on the front
But if the priest examines and if the diseased area has faded after it has been washed he shall tear it out of the garment or the skin or the warp or the woof
Then if it appears again in the garment in the warp or the woof or in any article made of skin it is spreading You shall burn with fire whatever has the disease
But the garment or the warp or the woof or any article made of skin from which the disease departs when you have washed it shall then be washed a second time and be clean
This is the law for a case of leprous disease in a garment of wool or linen either in the warp or the woof or in any article made of skin to determine whether it is clean or unclean
