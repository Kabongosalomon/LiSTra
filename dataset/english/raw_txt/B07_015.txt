1 Corienthians 15
Now I would remind you brothers of the gospel I preached to you which you received in which you stand
and by which you are being saved if you hold fast to the word I preached to you unless you believed in vain
For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures
that he was buried that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures
and that he appeared to Cephas then to the twelve
Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time most of whom are still alive though some have fallen asleep
Then he appeared to James then to all the apostles
Last of all as to one untimely born he appeared also to me
For I am the least of the apostles unworthy to be called an apostle because I persecuted the church of God
But by the grace of God I am what I am and his grace toward me was not in vain On the contrary I worked harder than any of them though it was not I but the grace of God that is with me
Whether then it was I or they so we preach and so you believed
Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead
But if there is no resurrection of the dead then not even Christ has been raised
And if Christ has not been raised then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain
We are even found to be misrepresenting God because we testified about God that he raised Christ whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised
For if the dead are not raised not even Christ has been raised
And if Christ has not been raised your faith is futile and you are still in your sins
Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished
If in Christ we have hope in this life only we are of all people most to be pitied
But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep
For as by a man came death by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead
For as in Adam all die so also in Christ shall all be made alive
But each in his own order Christ the firstfruits then at his coming those who belong to Christ
Then comes the end when he delivers the kingdom to God the Father after destroying every rule and every authority and power
For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet
The last enemy to be destroyed is death
For God has put all things in subjection under his feet But when it says all things are put in subjection it is plain that he is excepted who put all things in subjection under him
When all things are subjected to him then the Son himself will also be subjected to him who put all things in subjection under him that God may be all in all
Otherwise what do people mean by being baptized on behalf of the dead If the dead are not raised at all why are people baptized on their behalf
Why are we in danger every hour
I protest brothers by my pride in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord I die every day
What do I gain if humanly speaking I fought with beasts at Ephesus If the dead are not raised Let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die
Do not be deceived Bad company ruins good morals
Wake up from your drunken stupor as is right and do not go on sinning For some have no knowledge of God I say this to your shame
But someone will ask How are the dead raised With what kind of body do they come
You foolish person What you sow does not come to life unless it dies
And what you sow is not the body that is to be but a bare kernel perhaps of wheat or of some other grain
But God gives it a body as he has chosen and to each kind of seed its own body
For not all flesh is the same but there is one kind for humans another for animals another for birds and another for fish
There are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies but the glory of the heavenly is of one kind and the glory of the earthly is of another
There is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars for star differs from star in glory
So is it with the resurrection of the dead What is sown is perishable what is raised is imperishable
It is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory It is sown in weakness it is raised in power
It is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body If there is a natural body there is also a spiritual body
Thus it is written The first man Adam became a living being the last Adam became a life giving spirit
But it is not the spiritual that is first but the natural and then the spiritual
The first man was from the earth a man of dust the second man is from heaven
As was the man of dust so also are those who are of the dust and as is the man of heaven so also are those who are of heaven
Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust we shall also bear the image of the man of heaven
I tell you this brothers flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable
Behold I tell you a mystery We shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed
in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet For the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised imperishable and we shall be changed
For this perishable body must put on the imperishable and this mortal body must put on immortality
When the perishable puts on the imperishable and the mortal puts on immortality then shall come to pass the saying that is written Death is swallowed up in victory
O death where is your victory O death where is your sting
The sting of death is sin and the power of sin is the law
But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ
Therefore my beloved brothers be steadfast immovable always abounding in the work of the Lord knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain
