1 Kings 9
As soon as Solomon had finished building the house of the LORD and the king s house and all that Solomon desired to build
the LORD appeared to Solomon a second time as he had appeared to him at Gibeon
And the LORD said to him I have heard your prayer and your plea which you have made before me I have consecrated this house that you have built by putting my name there forever My eyes and my heart will be there for all time
And as for you if you will walk before me as David your father walked with integrity of heart and uprightness doing according to all that I have commanded you and keeping my statutes and my rules
then I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever as I promised David your father saying You shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel
But if you turn aside from following me you or your children and do not keep my commandments and my statutes that I have set before you but go and serve other gods and worship them
then I will cut off Israel from the land that I have given them and the house that I have consecrated for my name I will cast out of my sight and Israel will become a proverb and a byword among all peoples
And this house will become a heap of ruins Everyone passing by it will be astonished and will hiss and they will say Why has the LORD done thus to this land and to this house
Then they will say Because they abandoned the LORD their God who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt and laid hold on other gods and worshiped them and served them Therefore the LORD has brought all this disaster on them
At the end of twenty years in which Solomon had built the two houses the house of the LORD and the king s house
and Hiram king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar and cypress timber and gold as much as he desired King Solomon gave to Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee
But when Hiram came from Tyre to see the cities that Solomon had given him they did not please him
Therefore he said What kind of cities are these that you have given me my brother So they are called the land of Cabul to this day
Hiram had sent to the king talents of gold
And this is the account of the forced labor that King Solomon drafted to build the house of the LORD and his own house and the Millo and the wall of Jerusalem and Hazor and Megiddo and Gezer
Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and captured Gezer and burned it with fire and had killed the Canaanites who lived in the city and had given it as dowry to his daughter Solomon s wife
so Solomon rebuilt Gezer and Lower Beth horon
and Baalath and Tamar in the wilderness in the land of Judah
and all the store cities that Solomon had and the cities for his chariots and the cities for his horsemen and whatever Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem in Lebanon and in all the land of his dominion
All the people who were left of the Amorites the Hittites the Perizzites the Hivites and the Jebusites who were not of the people of Israel
their descendants who were left after them in the land whom the people of Israel were unable to devote to destruction these Solomon drafted to be slaves and so they are to this day
But of the people of Israel Solomon made no slaves They were the soldiers they were his officials his commanders his captains his chariot commanders and his horsemen
These were the chief officers who were over Solomon s work who had charge of the people who carried on the work
But Pharaoh s daughter went up from the city of David to her own house that Solomon had built for her Then he built the Millo
Three times a year Solomon used to offer up burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar that he built to the LORD making offerings with it before the LORD So he finished the house
King Solomon built a fleet of ships at Ezion geber which is near Eloth on the shore of the Red Sea in the land of Edom
And Hiram sent with the fleet his servants seamen who were familiar with the sea together with the servants of Solomon
And they went to Ophir and brought from there gold talents and they brought it to King Solomon
