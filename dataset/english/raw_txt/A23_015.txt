Isaiah 15
An oracle concerning Moab Because Ar of Moab is laid waste in a night Moab is undone because Kir of Moab is laid waste in a night Moab is undone
He has gone up to the temple and to Dibon to the high places to weep over Nebo and over Medeba Moab wails On every head is baldness every beard is shorn
in the streets they wear sackcloth on the housetops and in the squares everyone wails and melts in tears
Heshbon and Elealeh cry out their voice is heard as far as Jahaz therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud his soul trembles
My heart cries out for Moab her fugitives flee to Zoar to Eglath shelishiyah For at the ascent of Luhith they go up weeping on the road to Horonaim they raise a cry of destruction
the waters of Nimrim are a desolation the grass is withered the vegetation fails the greenery is no more
Therefore the abundance they have gained and what they have laid up they carry away over the Brook of the Willows
For a cry has gone around the land of Moab her wailing reaches to Eglaim her wailing reaches to Beer elim
For the waters of Dibon are full of blood for I will bring upon Dibon even more a lion for those of Moab who escape for the remnant of the land
