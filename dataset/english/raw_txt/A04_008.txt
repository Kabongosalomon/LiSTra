Numbers 8
Now the LORD spoke to Moses saying
Speak to Aaron and say to him When you set up the lamps the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lampstand
And Aaron did so he set up its lamps in front of the lampstand as the LORD commanded Moses
And this was the workmanship of the lampstand hammered work of gold From its base to its flowers it was hammered work according to the pattern that the LORD had shown Moses so he made the lampstand
And the LORD spoke to Moses saying
Take the Levites from among the people of Israel and cleanse them
Thus you shall do to them to cleanse them sprinkle the water of purification upon them and let them go with a razor over all their body and wash their clothes and cleanse themselves
Then let them take a bull from the herd and its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil and you shall take another bull from the herd for a sin offering
And you shall bring the Levites before the tent of meeting and assemble the whole congregation of the people of Israel
When you bring the Levites before the LORD the people of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites
and Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD as a wave offering from the people of Israel that they may do the service of the LORD
Then the Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls and you shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering to the LORD to make atonement for the Levites
And you shall set the Levites before Aaron and his sons and shall offer them as a wave offering to the LORD
Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the people of Israel and the Levites shall be mine
And after that the Levites shall go in to serve at the tent of meeting when you have cleansed them and offered them as a wave offering
For they are wholly given to me from among the people of Israel Instead of all who open the womb the firstborn of all the people of Israel I have taken them for myself
For all the firstborn among the people of Israel are mine both of man and of beast On the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I consecrated them for myself
and I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the people of Israel
And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons from among the people of Israel to do the service for the people of Israel at the tent of meeting and to make atonement for the people of Israel that there may be no plague among the people of Israel when the people of Israel come near the sanctuary
Thus did Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the people of Israel to the Levites According to all that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites the people of Israel did to them
And the Levites purified themselves from sin and washed their clothes and Aaron offered them as a wave offering before the LORD and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them
And after that the Levites went in to do their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron and his sons as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites so they did to them
And the LORD spoke to Moses saying
This applies to the Levites from twenty five years old and upward they shall come to do duty in the service of the tent of meeting
And from the age of fifty years they shall withdraw from the duty of the service and serve no more
They minister to their brothers in the tent of meeting by keeping guard but they shall do no service Thus shall you do to the Levites in assigning their duties
