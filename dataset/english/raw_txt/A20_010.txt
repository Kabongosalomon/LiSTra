Proverbs 10
The proverbs of Solomon A wise son makes a glad father but a foolish son is a sorrow to his mother
Treasures gained by wickedness do not profit but righteousness delivers from death
The LORD does not let the righteous go hungry but he thwarts the craving of the wicked
A slack hand causes poverty but the hand of the diligent makes rich
He who gathers in summer is a prudent son but he who sleeps in harvest is a son who brings shame
Blessings are on the head of the righteous but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence
The memory of the righteous is a blessing but the name of the wicked will rot
The wise of heart will receive commandments but a babbling fool will come to ruin
Whoever walks in integrity walks securely but he who makes his ways crooked will be found out
Whoever winks the eye causes trouble but a babbling fool will come to ruin
The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence
Hatred stirs up strife but love covers all offenses
On the lips of him who has understanding wisdom is found but a rod is for the back of him who lacks sense
The wise lay up knowledge but the mouth of a fool brings ruin near
A rich man s wealth is his strong city the poverty of the poor is their ruin
The wage of the righteous leads to life the gain of the wicked to sin
Whoever heeds instruction is on the path to life but he who rejects reproof leads others astray
The one who conceals hatred has lying lips and whoever utters slander is a fool
When words are many transgression is not lacking but whoever restrains his lips is prudent
The tongue of the righteous is choice silver the heart of the wicked is of little worth
The lips of the righteous feed many but fools die for lack of sense
The blessing of the LORD makes rich and he adds no sorrow with it
Doing wrong is like a joke to a fool but wisdom is pleasure to a man of understanding
What the wicked dreads will come upon him but the desire of the righteous will be granted
When the tempest passes the wicked is no more but the righteous is established forever
Like vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes so is the sluggard to those who send him
The fear of the LORD prolongs life but the years of the wicked will be short
The hope of the righteous brings joy but the expectation of the wicked will perish
The way of the LORD is a stronghold to the blameless but destruction to evildoers
The righteous will never be removed but the wicked will not dwell in the land
The mouth of the righteous brings forth wisdom but the perverse tongue will be cut off
The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable but the mouth of the wicked what is perverse
