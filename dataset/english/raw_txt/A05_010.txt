Deuteronomy 10
At that time the LORD said to me Cut for yourself two tablets of stone like the first and come up to me on the mountain and make an ark of wood
And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets that you broke and you shall put them in the ark
So I made an ark of acacia wood and cut two tablets of stone like the first and went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hand
And he wrote on the tablets in the same writing as before the Ten Commandments that the LORD had spoken to you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly And the LORD gave them to me
Then I turned and came down from the mountain and put the tablets in the ark that I had made And there they are as the LORD commanded me
The people of Israel journeyed from Beeroth Bene jaakan to Moserah There Aaron died and there he was buried And his son Eleazar ministered as priest in his place
From there they journeyed to Gudgodah and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah a land with brooks of water
At that time the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the LORD to stand before the LORD to minister to him and to bless in his name to this day
Therefore Levi has no portion or inheritance with his brothers The LORD is his inheritance as the LORD your God said to him
I myself stayed on the mountain as at the first time forty days and forty nights and the LORD listened to me that time also The LORD was unwilling to destroy you
And the LORD said to me Arise go on your journey at the head of the people so that they may go in and possess the land which I swore to their fathers to give them
And now Israel what does the LORD your God require of you but to fear the LORD your God to walk in all his ways to love him to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul
and to keep the commandments and statutes of the LORD which I am commanding you today for your good
Behold to the LORD your God belong heaven and the heaven of heavens the earth with all that is in it
Yet the LORD set his heart in love on your fathers and chose their offspring after them you above all peoples as you are this day
Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart and be no longer stubborn
For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords the great the mighty and the awesome God who is not partial and takes no bribe
He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow and loves the sojourner giving him food and clothing
Love the sojourner therefore for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt
You shall fear the LORD your God You shall serve him and hold fast to him and by his name you shall swear
He is your praise He is your God who has done for you these great and terrifying things that your eyes have seen
Your fathers went down to Egypt seventy persons and now the LORD your God has made you as numerous as the stars of heaven
