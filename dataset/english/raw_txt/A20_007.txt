Proverbs 7
My son keep my words and treasure up my commandments with you
keep my commandments and live keep my teaching as the apple of your eye
bind them on your fingers write them on the tablet of your heart
Say to wisdom You are my sister and call insight your intimate friend
to keep you from the forbidden woman from the adulteress with her smooth words
For at the window of my house I have looked out through my lattice
and I have seen among the simple I have perceived among the youths a young man lacking sense
passing along the street near her corner taking the road to her house
in the twilight in the evening at the time of night and darkness
And behold the woman meets him dressed as a prostitute wily of heart
She is loud and wayward her feet do not stay at home
now in the street now in the market and at every corner she lies in wait
She seizes him and kisses him and with bold face she says to him
I had to offer sacrifices and today I have paid my vows
so now I have come out to meet you to seek you eagerly and I have found you
I have spread my couch with coverings colored linens from Egyptian linen
I have perfumed my bed with myrrh aloes and cinnamon
Come let us take our fill of love till morning let us delight ourselves with love
For my husband is not at home he has gone on a long journey
he took a bag of money with him at full moon he will come home
With much seductive speech she persuades him with her smooth talk she compels him
All at once he follows her as an ox goes to the slaughter or as a stag is caught fast
till an arrow pierces its liver as a bird rushes into a snare he does not know that it will cost him his life
And now O sons listen to me and be attentive to the words of my mouth
Let not your heart turn aside to her ways do not stray into her paths
for many a victim has she laid low and all her slain are a mighty throng
Her house is the way to Sheol going down to the chambers of death
