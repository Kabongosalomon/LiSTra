Luke 6
On a Sabbath while he was going through the grainfields his disciples plucked and ate some heads of grain rubbing them in their hands
But some of the Pharisees said Why are you doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath
And Jesus answered them Have you not read what David did when he was hungry he and those who were with him
how he entered the house of God and took and ate the bread of the Presence which is not lawful for any but the priests to eat and also gave it to those with him
And he said to them The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath
On another Sabbath he entered the synagogue and was teaching and a man was there whose right hand was withered
And the scribes and the Pharisees watched him to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath so that they might find a reason to accuse him
But he knew their thoughts and he said to the man with the withered hand Come and stand here And he rose and stood there
And Jesus said to them I ask you is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm to save life or to destroy it
And after looking around at them all he said to him Stretch out your hand And he did so and his hand was restored
But they were filled with fury and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus
In these days he went out to the mountain to pray and all night he continued in prayer to God
And when day came he called his disciples and chose from them twelve whom he named apostles
Simon whom he named Peter and Andrew his brother and James and John and Philip and Bartholomew
and Matthew and Thomas and James the son of Alphaeus and Simon who was called the Zealot
and Judas the son of James and Judas Iscariot who became a traitor
And he came down with them and stood on a level place with a great crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon
who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases And those who were troubled with unclean spirits were cured
And all the crowd sought to touch him for power came out from him and healed them all
And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples and said Blessed are you who are poor for yours is the kingdom of God
Blessed are you who are hungry now for you shall be satisfied Blessed are you who weep now for you shall laugh
Blessed are you when people hate you and when they exclude you and revile you and spurn your name as evil on account of the Son of Man
Rejoice in that day and leap for joy for behold your reward is great in heaven for so their fathers did to the prophets
But woe to you who are rich for you have received your consolation
Woe to you who are full now for you shall be hungry Woe to you who laugh now for you shall mourn and weep
Woe to you when all people speak well of you for so their fathers did to the false prophets
But I say to you who hear Love your enemies do good to those who hate you
bless those who curse you pray for those who abuse you
To one who strikes you on the cheek offer the other also and from one who takes away your cloak do not withhold your tunic either
Give to everyone who begs from you and from one who takes away your goods do not demand them back
And as you wish that others would do to you do so to them
If you love those who love you what benefit is that to you For even sinners love those who love them
And if you do good to those who do good to you what benefit is that to you For even sinners do the same
And if you lend to those from whom you expect to receive what credit is that to you Even sinners lend to sinners to get back the same amount
But love your enemies and do good and lend expecting nothing in return and your reward will be great and you will be sons of the Most High for he is kind to the ungrateful and the evil
Be merciful even as your Father is merciful
Judge not and you will not be judged condemn not and you will not be condemned forgive and you will be forgiven
give and it will be given to you Good measure pressed down shaken together running over will be put into your lap For with the measure you use it will be measured back to you
He also told them a parable Can a blind man lead a blind man Will they not both fall into a pit
A disciple is not above his teacher but everyone when he is fully trained will be like his teacher
Why do you see the speck that is in your brother s eye but do not notice the log that is in your own eye
How can you say to your brother Brother let me take out the speck that is in your eye when you yourself do not see the log that is in your own eye You hypocrite first take the log out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother s eye
For no good tree bears bad fruit nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit
for each tree is known by its own fruit For figs are not gathered from thornbushes nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush
The good person out of the good treasure of his heart produces good and the evil person out of his evil treasure produces evil for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks
Why do you call me Lord Lord and not do what I tell you
Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and does them I will show you what he is like
he is like a man building a house who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock And when a flood arose the stream broke against that house and could not shake it because it had been well built
But the one who hears and does not do them is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation When the stream broke against it immediately it fell and the ruin of that house was great
