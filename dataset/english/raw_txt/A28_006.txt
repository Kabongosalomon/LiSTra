Hosea 6
Come let us return to the LORD for he has torn us that he may heal us he has struck us down and he will bind us up
After two days he will revive us on the third day he will raise us up that we may live before him
Let us know let us press on to know the LORD his going out is sure as the dawn he will come to us as the showers as the spring rains that water the earth
What shall I do with you O Ephraim What shall I do with you O Judah Your love is like a morning cloud like the dew that goes early away
Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets I have slain them by the words of my mouth and my judgment goes forth as the light
For I desire steadfast love and not sacrifice the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings
But like Adam they transgressed the covenant there they dealt faithlessly with me
Gilead is a city of evildoers tracked with blood
As robbers lie in wait for a man so the priests band together they murder on the way to Shechem they commit villainy
In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing Ephraim s whoredom is there Israel is defiled
For you also O Judah a harvest is appointed when I restore the fortunes of my people
