Deuteronomy 32
Give ear O heavens and I will speak and let the earth hear the words of my mouth
May my teaching drop as the rain my speech distill as the dew like gentle rain upon the tender grass and like showers upon the herb
For I will proclaim the name of the LORD ascribe greatness to our God
The Rock his work is perfect for all his ways are justice A God of faithfulness and without iniquity just and upright is he
They have dealt corruptly with him they are no longer his children because they are blemished they are a crooked and twisted generation
Do you thus repay the LORD you foolish and senseless people Is not he your father who created you who made you and established you
Remember the days of old consider the years of many generations ask your father and he will show you your elders and they will tell you
When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance when he divided mankind he fixed the borders of the peoples according to the number of the sons of God
But the LORD s portion is his people Jacob his allotted heritage
He found him in a desert land and in the howling waste of the wilderness he encircled him he cared for him he kept him as the apple of his eye
Like an eagle that stirs up its nest that flutters over its young spreading out its wings catching them bearing them on its pinions
the LORD alone guided him no foreign god was with him
He made him ride on the high places of the land and he ate the produce of the field and he suckled him with honey out of the rock and oil out of the flinty rock
Curds from the herd and milk from the flock with fat of lambs rams of Bashan and goats with the very finest of the wheat and you drank foaming wine made from the blood of the grape
But Jeshurun grew fat and kicked you grew fat stout and sleek then he forsook God who made him and scoffed at the Rock of his salvation
They stirred him to jealousy with strange gods with abominations they provoked him to anger
They sacrificed to demons that were no gods to gods they had never known to new gods that had come recently whom your fathers had never dreaded
You were unmindful of the Rock that bore you and you forgot the God who gave you birth
The LORD saw it and spurned them because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters
And he said I will hide my face from them I will see what their end will be For they are a perverse generation children in whom is no faithfulness
They have made me jealous with what is no god they have provoked me to anger with their idols So I will make them jealous with those who are no people I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation
For a fire is kindled by my anger and it burns to the depths of Sheol devours the earth and its increase and sets on fire the foundations of the mountains
And I will heap disasters upon them I will spend my arrows on them
they shall be wasted with hunger and devoured by plague and poisonous pestilence I will send the teeth of beasts against them with the venom of things that crawl in the dust
Outdoors the sword shall bereave and indoors terror for young man and woman alike the nursing child with the man of gray hairs
I would have said I will cut them to pieces I will wipe them from human memory
had I not feared provocation by the enemy lest their adversaries should misunderstand lest they should say Our hand is triumphant it was not the LORD who did all this
For they are a nation void of counsel and there is no understanding in them
If they were wise they would understand this they would discern their latter end
How could one have chased a thousand and two have put ten thousand to flight unless their Rock had sold them and the LORD had given them up
For their rock is not as our Rock our enemies are by themselves
For their vine comes from the vine of Sodom and from the fields of Gomorrah their grapes are grapes of poison their clusters are bitter
their wine is the poison of serpents and the cruel venom of asps
Is not this laid up in store with me sealed up in my treasuries
Vengeance is mine and recompense for the time when their foot shall slip for the day of their calamity is at hand and their doom comes swiftly
For the LORD will vindicate his people and have compassion on his servants when he sees that their power is gone and there is none remaining bond or free
Then he will say Where are their gods the rock in which they took refuge
who ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offering Let them rise up and help you let them be your protection
See now that I even I am he and there is no god beside me I kill and I make alive I wound and I heal and there is none that can deliver out of my hand
For I lift up my hand to heaven and swear As I live forever
if I sharpen my flashing sword and my hand takes hold on judgment I will take vengeance on my adversaries and will repay those who hate me
I will make my arrows drunk with blood and my sword shall devour flesh with the blood of the slain and the captives from the long haired heads of the enemy
Rejoice with him O heavens bow down to him all gods for he avenges the blood of his children and takes vengeance on his adversaries He repays those who hate him and cleanses his people s land
Moses came and recited all the words of this song in the hearing of the people he and Joshua the son of Nun
And when Moses had finished speaking all these words to all Israel
he said to them Take to heart all the words by which I am warning you today that you may command them to your children that they may be careful to do all the words of this law
For it is no empty word for you but your very life and by this word you shall live long in the land that you are going over the Jordan to possess
That very day the LORD spoke to Moses
Go up this mountain of the Abarim Mount Nebo which is in the land of Moab opposite Jericho and view the land of Canaan which I am giving to the people of Israel for a possession
And die on the mountain which you go up and be gathered to your people as Aaron your brother died in Mount Hor and was gathered to his people
because you broke faith with me in the midst of the people of Israel at the waters of Meribah kadesh in the wilderness of Zin and because you did not treat me as holy in the midst of the people of Israel
For you shall see the land before you but you shall not go there into the land that I am giving to the people of Israel
