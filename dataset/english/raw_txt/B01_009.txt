Matthew 9
And getting into a boat he crossed over and came to his own city
And behold some people brought to him a paralytic lying on a bed And when Jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic Take heart my son your sins are forgiven
And behold some of the scribes said to themselves This man is blaspheming
But Jesus knowing their thoughts said Why do you think evil in your hearts
For which is easier to say Your sins are forgiven or to say Rise and walk
But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins he then said to the paralytic Rise pick up your bed and go home
And he rose and went home
When the crowds saw it they were afraid and they glorified God who had given such authority to men
As Jesus passed on from there he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth and he said to him Follow me And he rose and followed him
And as Jesus reclined at table in the house behold many tax collectors and sinners came and were reclining with Jesus and his disciples
And when the Pharisees saw this they said to his disciples Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners
But when he heard it he said Those who are well have no need of a physician but those who are sick
Go and learn what this means I desire mercy and not sacrifice For I came not to call the righteous but sinners
Then the disciples of John came to him saying Why do we and the Pharisees fast but your disciples do not fast
And Jesus said to them Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them and then they will fast
No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment for the patch tears away from the garment and a worse tear is made
Neither is new wine put into old wineskins If it is the skins burst and the wine is spilled and the skins are destroyed But new wine is put into fresh wineskins and so both are preserved
While he was saying these things to them behold a ruler came in and knelt before him saying My daughter has just died but come and lay your hand on her and she will live
And Jesus rose and followed him with his disciples
And behold a woman who had suffered from a discharge of blood for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment
for she said to herself If I only touch his garment I will be made well
Jesus turned and seeing her he said Take heart daughter your faith has made you well And instantly the woman was made well
And when Jesus came to the ruler s house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion
he said Go away for the girl is not dead but sleeping And they laughed at him
But when the crowd had been put outside he went in and took her by the hand and the girl arose
And the report of this went through all that district
And as Jesus passed on from there two blind men followed him crying aloud Have mercy on us Son of David
When he entered the house the blind men came to him and Jesus said to them Do you believe that I am able to do this They said to him Yes Lord
Then he touched their eyes saying According to your faith be it done to you
And their eyes were opened And Jesus sternly warned them See that no one knows about it
But they went away and spread his fame through all that district
As they were going away behold a demon oppressed man who was mute was brought to him
And when the demon had been cast out the mute man spoke And the crowds marveled saying Never was anything like this seen in Israel
But the Pharisees said He casts out demons by the prince of demons
And Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction
When he saw the crowds he had compassion for them because they were harassed and helpless like sheep without a shepherd
Then he said to his disciples The harvest is plentiful but the laborers are few
therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest
