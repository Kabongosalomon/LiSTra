Deuteronomy 25
If there is a dispute between men and they come into court and the judges decide between them acquitting the innocent and condemning the guilty
then if the guilty man deserves to be beaten the judge shall cause him to lie down and be beaten in his presence with a number of stripes in proportion to his offense
Forty stripes may be given him but not more lest if one should go on to beat him with more stripes than these your brother be degraded in your sight
You shall not muzzle an ox when it is treading out the grain
If brothers dwell together and one of them dies and has no son the wife of the dead man shall not be married outside the family to a stranger Her husband s brother shall go in to her and take her as his wife and perform the duty of a husband s brother to her
And the first son whom she bears shall succeed to the name of his dead brother that his name may not be blotted out of Israel
And if the man does not wish to take his brother s wife then his brother s wife shall go up to the gate to the elders and say My husband s brother refuses to perpetuate his brother s name in Israel he will not perform the duty of a husband s brother to me
Then the elders of his city shall call him and speak to him and if he persists saying I do not wish to take her
then his brother s wife shall go up to him in the presence of the elders and pull his sandal off his foot and spit in his face And she shall answer and say So shall it be done to the man who does not build up his brother s house
And the name of his house shall be called in Israel The house of him who had his sandal pulled off
When men fight with one another and the wife of the one draws near to rescue her husband from the hand of him who is beating him and puts out her hand and seizes him by the private parts
then you shall cut off her hand Your eye shall have no pity
You shall not have in your bag two kinds of weights a large and a small
You shall not have in your house two kinds of measures a large and a small
A full and fair weight you shall have a full and fair measure you shall have that your days may be long in the land that the LORD your God is giving you
For all who do such things all who act dishonestly are an abomination to the LORD your God
Remember what Amalek did to you on the way as you came out of Egypt
how he attacked you on the way when you were faint and weary and cut off your tail those who were lagging behind you and he did not fear God
Therefore when the LORD your God has given you rest from all your enemies around you in the land that the LORD your God is giving you for an inheritance to possess you shall blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven you shall not forget
