Numbers 31
The LORD spoke to Moses saying
Avenge the people of Israel on the Midianites Afterward you shall be gathered to your people
So Moses spoke to the people saying Arm men from among you for the war that they may go against Midian to execute the LORD s vengeance on Midian
You shall send a thousand from each of the tribes of Israel to the war
So there were provided out of the thousands of Israel a thousand from each tribe twelve thousand armed for war
And Moses sent them to the war a thousand from each tribe together with Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand
They warred against Midian as the LORD commanded Moses and killed every male
They killed the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain Evi Rekem Zur Hur and Reba the five kings of Midian And they also killed Balaam the son of Beor with the sword
And the people of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones and they took as plunder all their cattle their flocks and all their goods
All their cities in the places where they lived and all their encampments they burned with fire
and took all the spoil and all the plunder both of man and of beast
Then they brought the captives and the plunder and the spoil to Moses and to Eleazar the priest and to the congregation of the people of Israel at the camp on the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho
Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the chiefs of the congregation went to meet them outside the camp
And Moses was angry with the officers of the army the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds who had come from service in the war
Moses said to them Have you let all the women live
Behold these on Balaam s advice caused the people of Israel to act treacherously against the LORD in the incident of Peor and so the plague came among the congregation of the LORD
Now therefore kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman who has known man by lying with him
But all the young girls who have not known man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves
Encamp outside the camp seven days Whoever of you has killed any person and whoever has touched any slain purify yourselves and your captives on the third day and on the seventh day
You shall purify every garment every article of skin all work of goats hair and every article of wood
Then Eleazar the priest said to the men in the army who had gone to battle This is the statute of the law that the LORD has commanded Moses
only the gold the silver the bronze the iron the tin and the lead
everything that can stand the fire you shall pass through the fire and it shall be clean Nevertheless it shall also be purified with the water for impurity And whatever cannot stand the fire you shall pass through the water
You must wash your clothes on the seventh day and you shall be clean And afterward you may come into the camp
The LORD said to Moses
Take the count of the plunder that was taken both of man and of beast you and Eleazar the priest and the heads of the fathers houses of the congregation
and divide the plunder into two parts between the warriors who went out to battle and all the congregation
And levy for the LORD a tribute from the men of war who went out to battle one out of five hundred of the people and of the oxen and of the donkeys and of the flocks
Take it from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest as a contribution to the LORD
And from the people of Israel s half you shall take one drawn out of every fifty of the people of the oxen of the donkeys and of the flocks of all the cattle and give them to the Levites who keep guard over the tabernacle of the LORD
And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses
Now the plunder remaining of the spoil that the army took was sheep
cattle
donkeys
and persons in all women who had not known man by lying with him
And the half the portion of those who had gone out in the army numbered sheep
and the LORD s tribute of sheep was
The cattle were of which the LORD s tribute was
The donkeys were of which the LORD s tribute was
The persons were of which the LORD s tribute was persons
And Moses gave the tribute which was the contribution for the LORD to Eleazar the priest as the LORD commanded Moses
From the people of Israel s half which Moses separated from that of the men who had served in the army
now the congregation s half was sheep
cattle
and donkeys
and persons
from the people of Israel s half Moses took one of every both of persons and of beasts and gave them to the Levites who kept guard over the tabernacle of the LORD as the LORD commanded Moses
Then the officers who were over the thousands of the army the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds came near to Moses
and said to Moses Your servants have counted the men of war who are under our command and there is not a man missing from us
And we have brought the LORD s offering what each man found articles of gold armlets and bracelets signet rings earrings and beads to make atonement for ourselves before the LORD
And Moses and Eleazar the priest received from them the gold all crafted articles
And all the gold of the contribution that they presented to the LORD from the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds was shekels
The men in the army had each taken plunder for himself
And Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from the commanders of thousands and of hundreds and brought it into the tent of meeting as a memorial for the people of Israel before the LORD
