1 Samuel 19
And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son and to all his servants that they should kill David But Jonathan Saul s son delighted much in David
And Jonathan told David Saul my father seeks to kill you Therefore be on your guard in the morning Stay in a secret place and hide yourself
And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are and I will speak to my father about you And if I learn anything I will tell you
And Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him Let not the king sin against his servant David because he has not sinned against you and because his deeds have brought good to you
For he took his life in his hand and he struck down the Philistine and the LORD worked a great salvation for all Israel You saw it and rejoiced Why then will you sin against innocent blood by killing David without cause
And Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan Saul swore As the LORD lives he shall not be put to death
And Jonathan called David and Jonathan reported to him all these things And Jonathan brought David to Saul and he was in his presence as before
And there was war again And David went out and fought with the Philistines and struck them with a great blow so that they fled before him
Then a harmful spirit from the LORD came upon Saul as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand And David was playing the lyre
And Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear but he eluded Saul so that he struck the spear into the wall And David fled and escaped that night
Saul sent messengers to David s house to watch him that he might kill him in the morning But Michal David s wife told him If you do not escape with your life tonight tomorrow you will be killed
So Michal let David down through the window and he fled away and escaped
Michal took an image and laid it on the bed and put a pillow of goats hair at its head and covered it with the clothes
And when Saul sent messengers to take David she said He is sick
Then Saul sent the messengers to see David saying Bring him up to me in the bed that I may kill him
And when the messengers came in behold the image was in the bed with the pillow of goats hair at its head
Saul said to Michal Why have you deceived me thus and let my enemy go so that he has escaped And Michal answered Saul He said to me Let me go Why should I kill you
Now David fled and escaped and he came to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him And he and Samuel went and lived at Naioth
And it was told Saul Behold David is at Naioth in Ramah
Then Saul sent messengers to take David and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying and Samuel standing as head over them the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul and they also prophesied
When it was told Saul he sent other messengers and they also prophesied And Saul sent messengers again the third time and they also prophesied
Then he himself went to Ramah and came to the great well that is in Secu And he asked Where are Samuel and David And one said Behold they are at Naioth in Ramah
And he went there to Naioth in Ramah And the Spirit of God came upon him also and as he went he prophesied until he came to Naioth in Ramah
And he too stripped off his clothes and he too prophesied before Samuel and lay naked all that day and all that night Thus it is said Is Saul also among the prophets
