Joshua 7
But the people of Israel broke faith in regard to the devoted things for Achan the son of Carmi son of Zabdi son of Zerah of the tribe of Judah took some of the devoted things And the anger of the LORD burned against the people of Israel
Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai which is near Beth aven east of Bethel and said to them Go up and spy out the land And the men went up and spied out Ai
And they returned to Joshua and said to him Do not have all the people go up but let about two or three thousand men go up and attack Ai Do not make the whole people toil up there for they are few
So about men went up there from the people And they fled before the men of Ai
and the men of Ai killed about thirty six of their men and chased them before the gate as far as Shebarim and struck them at the descent And the hearts of the people melted and became as water
Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the LORD until the evening he and the elders of Israel And they put dust on their heads
And Joshua said Alas O Lord GOD why have you brought this people over the Jordan at all to give us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us Would that we had been content to dwell beyond the Jordan
O Lord what can I say when Israel has turned their backs before their enemies
For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it and will surround us and cut off our name from the earth And what will you do for your great name
The LORD said to Joshua Get up Why have you fallen on your face
Israel has sinned they have transgressed my covenant that I commanded them they have taken some of the devoted things they have stolen and lied and put them among their own belongings
Therefore the people of Israel cannot stand before their enemies They turn their backs before their enemies because they have become devoted for destruction I will be with you no more unless you destroy the devoted things from among you
Get up Consecrate the people and say Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow for thus says the LORD God of Israel There are devoted things in your midst O Israel You cannot stand before your enemies until you take away the devoted things from among you
In the morning therefore you shall be brought near by your tribes And the tribe that the LORD takes by lot shall come near by clans And the clan that the LORD takes shall come near by households And the household that the LORD takes shall come near man by man
And he who is taken with the devoted things shall be burned with fire he and all that he has because he has transgressed the covenant of the LORD and because he has done an outrageous thing in Israel
So Joshua rose early in the morning and brought Israel near tribe by tribe and the tribe of Judah was taken
And he brought near the clans of Judah and the clan of the Zerahites was taken And he brought near the clan of the Zerahites man by man and Zabdi was taken
And he brought near his household man by man and Achan the son of Carmi son of Zabdi son of Zerah of the tribe of Judah was taken
Then Joshua said to Achan My son give glory to the LORD God of Israel and give praise to him And tell me now what you have done do not hide it from me
And Achan answered Joshua Truly I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel and this is what I did
when I saw among the spoil a beautiful cloak from Shinar and shekels of silver and a bar of gold weighing shekels then I coveted them and took them And see they are hidden in the earth inside my tent with the silver underneath
So Joshua sent messengers and they ran to the tent and behold it was hidden in his tent with the silver underneath
And they took them out of the tent and brought them to Joshua and to all the people of Israel And they laid them down before the LORD
And Joshua and all Israel with him took Achan the son of Zerah and the silver and the cloak and the bar of gold and his sons and daughters and his oxen and donkeys and sheep and his tent and all that he had And they brought them up to the Valley of Achor
And Joshua said Why did you bring trouble on us The LORD brings trouble on you today And all Israel stoned him with stones They burned them with fire and stoned them with stones
And they raised over him a great heap of stones that remains to this day Then the LORD turned from his burning anger Therefore to this day the name of that place is called the Valley of Achor
