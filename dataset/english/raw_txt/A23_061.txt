Isaiah 61
The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me because the LORD has anointed me to bring good news to the poor he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to those who are bound
to proclaim the year of the LORD s favor and the day of vengeance of our God to comfort all who mourn
to grant to those who mourn in Zion to give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes the oil of gladness instead of mourning the garment of praise instead of a faint spirit that they may be called oaks of righteousness the planting of the LORD that he may be glorified
They shall build up the ancient ruins they shall raise up the former devastations they shall repair the ruined cities the devastations of many generations
Strangers shall stand and tend your flocks foreigners shall be your plowmen and vinedressers
but you shall be called the priests of the LORD they shall speak of you as the ministers of our God you shall eat the wealth of the nations and in their glory you shall boast
Instead of your shame there shall be a double portion instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their lot therefore in their land they shall possess a double portion they shall have everlasting joy
For I the LORD love justice I hate robbery and wrong I will faithfully give them their recompense and I will make an everlasting covenant with them
Their offspring shall be known among the nations and their descendants in the midst of the peoples all who see them shall acknowledge them that they are an offspring the LORD has blessed
I will greatly rejoice in the LORD my soul shall exult in my God for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation he has covered me with the robe of righteousness as a bridegroom decks himself like a priest with a beautiful headdress and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels
For as the earth brings forth its sprouts and as a garden causes what is sown in it to sprout up so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to sprout up before all the nations
