Exodus 4
Then Moses answered But behold they will not believe me or listen to my voice for they will say The LORD did not appear to you
The LORD said to him What is that in your hand He said A staff
And he said Throw it on the ground So he threw it on the ground and it became a serpent and Moses ran from it
But the LORD said to Moses Put out your hand and catch it by the tail so he put out his hand and caught it and it became a staff in his hand
that they may believe that the LORD the God of their fathers the God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob has appeared to you
Again the LORD said to him Put your hand inside your cloak And he put his hand inside his cloak and when he took it out behold his hand was leprous like snow
Then God said Put your hand back inside your cloak So he put his hand back inside his cloak and when he took it out behold it was restored like the rest of his flesh
If they will not believe you God said or listen to the first sign they may believe the latter sign
If they will not believe even these two signs or listen to your voice you shall take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground and the water that you shall take from the Nile will become blood on the dry ground
But Moses said to the LORD Oh my Lord I am not eloquent either in the past or since you have spoken to your servant but I am slow of speech and of tongue
Then the LORD said to him Who has made man s mouth Who makes him mute or deaf or seeing or blind Is it not I the LORD
Now therefore go and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall speak
But he said Oh my Lord please send someone else
Then the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses and he said Is there not Aaron your brother the Levite I know that he can speak well Behold he is coming out to meet you and when he sees you he will be glad in his heart
You shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth and I will be with your mouth and with his mouth and will teach you both what to do
He shall speak for you to the people and he shall be your mouth and you shall be as God to him
And take in your hand this staff with which you shall do the signs
Moses went back to Jethro his father in law and said to him Please let me go back to my brothers in Egypt to see whether they are still alive And Jethro said to Moses Go in peace
And the LORD said to Moses in Midian Go back to Egypt for all the men who were seeking your life are dead
So Moses took his wife and his sons and had them ride on a donkey and went back to the land of Egypt And Moses took the staff of God in his hand
And the LORD said to Moses When you go back to Egypt see that you do before Pharaoh all the miracles that I have put in your power But I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go
Then you shall say to Pharaoh Thus says the LORD Israel is my firstborn son
and I say to you Let my son go that he may serve me If you refuse to let him go behold I will kill your firstborn son
At a lodging place on the way the LORD met him and sought to put him to death
Then Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son s foreskin and touched Moses feet with it and said Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me
So he let him alone It was then that she said A bridegroom of blood because of the circumcision
The LORD said to Aaron Go into the wilderness to meet Moses So he went and met him at the mountain of God and kissed him
And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD with which he had sent him to speak and all the signs that he had commanded him to do
Then Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the people of Israel
Aaron spoke all the words that the LORD had spoken to Moses and did the signs in the sight of the people
And the people believed and when they heard that the LORD had visited the people of Israel and that he had seen their affliction they bowed their heads and worshiped
