Ezekiel 27
The word of the LORD came to me
Now you son of man raise a lamentation over Tyre
and say to Tyre who dwells at the entrances to the sea merchant of the peoples to many coastlands thus says the Lord GOD O Tyre you have said I am perfect in beauty
Your borders are in the heart of the seas your builders made perfect your beauty
They made all your planks of fir trees from Senir they took a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you
Of oaks of Bashan they made your oars they made your deck of pines from the coasts of Cyprus inlaid with ivory
Of fine embroidered linen from Egypt was your sail serving as your banner blue and purple from the coasts of Elishah was your awning
The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your rowers your skilled men O Tyre were in you they were your pilots
The elders of Gebal and her skilled men were in you caulking your seams all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in you to barter for your wares
Persia and Lud and Put were in your army as your men of war They hung the shield and helmet in you they gave you splendor
Men of Arvad and Helech were on your walls all around and men of Gamad were in your towers They hung their shields on your walls all around they made perfect your beauty
Tarshish did business with you because of your great wealth of every kind silver iron tin and lead they exchanged for your wares
Javan Tubal and Meshech traded with you they exchanged human beings and vessels of bronze for your merchandise
From Beth togarmah they exchanged horses war horses and mules for your wares
The men of Dedan traded with you Many coastlands were your own special markets they brought you in payment ivory tusks and ebony

The traders of Sheba and Raamah traded with you they exchanged for your wares the best of all kinds of spices and all precious stones and gold
Haran Canneh Eden traders of Sheba Asshur and Chilmad traded with you
In your market these traded with you in choice garments in clothes of blue and embroidered work and in carpets of colored material bound with cords and made secure
The ships of Tarshish traveled for you with your merchandise So you were filled and heavily laden in the heart of the seas
Your rowers have brought you out into the high seas The east wind has wrecked you in the heart of the seas
Your riches your wares your merchandise your mariners and your pilots your caulkers your dealers in merchandise and all your men of war who are in you with all your crew that is in your midst sink into the heart of the seas on the day of your fall
At the sound of the cry of your pilots the countryside shakes
and down from their ships come all who handle the oar The mariners and all the pilots of the sea stand on the land
and shout aloud over you and cry out bitterly They cast dust on their heads and wallow in ashes
they make themselves bald for you and put sackcloth on their waist and they weep over you in bitterness of soul with bitter mourning
In their wailing they raise a lamentation for you and lament over you Who is like Tyre like one destroyed in the midst of the sea
When your wares came from the seas you satisfied many peoples with your abundant wealth and merchandise you enriched the kings of the earth
Now you are wrecked by the seas in the depths of the waters your merchandise and all your crew in your midst have sunk with you
All the inhabitants of the coastlands are appalled at you and the hair of their kings bristles with horror their faces are convulsed
The merchants among the peoples hiss at you you have come to a dreadful end and shall be no more forever
