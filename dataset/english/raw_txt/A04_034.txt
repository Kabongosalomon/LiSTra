And your border shall turn south of the ascent of Akrabbim and cross to Zin and its limit shall be south of Kadesh barnea Then it shall go on to Hazar addar and pass along to Azmon
And the border shall turn from Azmon to the Brook of Egypt and its limit shall be at the sea
For the western border you shall have the Great Sea and its coast This shall be your western border
This shall be your northern border from the Great Sea you shall draw a line to Mount Hor
