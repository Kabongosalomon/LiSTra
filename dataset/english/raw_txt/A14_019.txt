2 Chronicles 19
Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned in safety to his house in Jerusalem
But Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him and said to King Jehoshaphat Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the LORD Because of this wrath has gone out against you from the LORD
Nevertheless some good is found in you for you destroyed the Asherahs out of the land and have set your heart to seek God
Jehoshaphat lived at Jerusalem And he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim and brought them back to the LORD the God of their fathers
He appointed judges in the land in all the fortified cities of Judah city by city
and said to the judges Consider what you do for you judge not for man but for the LORD He is with you in giving judgment
Now then let the fear of the LORD be upon you Be careful what you do for there is no injustice with the LORD our God or partiality or taking bribes
Moreover in Jerusalem Jehoshaphat appointed certain Levites and priests and heads of families of Israel to give judgment for the LORD and to decide disputed cases They had their seat at Jerusalem
And he charged them Thus you shall do in the fear of the LORD in faithfulness and with your whole heart
whenever a case comes to you from your brothers who live in their cities concerning bloodshed law or commandment statutes or rules then you shall warn them that they may not incur guilt before the LORD and wrath may not come upon you and your brothers Thus you shall do and you will not incur guilt
And behold Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the LORD and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael the governor of the house of Judah in all the king s matters and the Levites will serve you as officers Deal courageously and may the LORD be with the upright
