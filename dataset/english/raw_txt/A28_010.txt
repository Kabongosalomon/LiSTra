Hosea 10
Israel is a luxuriant vine that yields its fruit The more his fruit increased the more altars he built as his country improved he improved his pillars
Their heart is false now they must bear their guilt The LORD will break down their altars and destroy their pillars
For now they will say We have no king for we do not fear the LORD and a king what could he do for us
They utter mere words with empty oaths they make covenants so judgment springs up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field
The inhabitants of Samaria tremble for the calf of Beth aven Its people mourn for it and so do its idolatrous priests those who rejoiced over it and over its glory for it has departed from them
The thing itself shall be carried to Assyria as tribute to the great king Ephraim shall be put to shame and Israel shall be ashamed of his idol
Samaria s king shall perish like a twig on the face of the waters
The high places of Aven the sin of Israel shall be destroyed Thorn and thistle shall grow up on their altars and they shall say to the mountains Cover us and to the hills Fall on us
From the days of Gibeah you have sinned O Israel there they have continued Shall not the war against the unjust overtake them in Gibeah
When I please I will discipline them and nations shall be gathered against them when they are bound up for their double iniquity
Ephraim was a trained calf that loved to thresh and I spared her fair neck but I will put Ephraim to the yoke Judah must plow Jacob must harrow for himself
Sow for yourselves righteousness reap steadfast love break up your fallow ground for it is the time to seek the LORD that he may come and rain righteousness upon you
You have plowed iniquity you have reaped injustice you have eaten the fruit of lies Because you have trusted in your own way and in the multitude of your warriors
therefore the tumult of war shall arise among your people and all your fortresses shall be destroyed as Shalman destroyed Beth arbel on the day of battle mothers were dashed in pieces with their children
Thus it shall be done to you O Bethel because of your great evil At dawn the king of Israel shall be utterly cut off
