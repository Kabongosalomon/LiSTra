Mark 13
And as he came out of the temple one of his disciples said to him Look Teacher what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings
And Jesus said to him Do you see these great buildings There will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down
And as he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately
Tell us when will these things be and what will be the sign when all these things are about to be accomplished
And Jesus began to say to them See that no one leads you astray
Many will come in my name saying I am he and they will lead many astray
And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars do not be alarmed This must take place but the end is not yet
For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom There will be earthquakes in various places there will be famines These are but the beginning of the birth pains
But be on your guard For they will deliver you over to councils and you will be beaten in synagogues and you will stand before governors and kings for my sake to bear witness before them
And the gospel must first be proclaimed to all nations
And when they bring you to trial and deliver you over do not be anxious beforehand what you are to say but say whatever is given you in that hour for it is not you who speak but the Holy Spirit
And brother will deliver brother over to death and the father his child and children will rise against parents and have them put to death
And you will be hated by all for my name s sake But the one who endures to the end will be saved
But when you see the abomination of desolation standing where he ought not to be let the reader understand then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains
Let the one who is on the housetop not go down nor enter his house to take anything out
and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak
And alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days
Pray that it may not happen in winter
For in those days there will be such tribulation as has not been from the beginning of the creation that God created until now and never will be
And if the Lord had not cut short the days no human being would be saved But for the sake of the elect whom he chose he shortened the days
And then if anyone says to you Look here is the Christ or Look there he is do not believe it
For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform signs and wonders to lead astray if possible the elect
But be on guard I have told you all things beforehand
But in those days after that tribulation the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light
and the stars will be falling from heaven and the powers in the heavens will be shaken
And then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory
And then he will send out the angels and gather his elect from the four winds from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven
From the fig tree learn its lesson as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves you know that summer is near
So also when you see these things taking place you know that he is near at the very gates
Truly I say to you this generation will not pass away until all these things take place
Heaven and earth will pass away but my words will not pass away
But concerning that day or that hour no one knows not even the angels in heaven nor the Son but only the Father
Be on guard keep awake For you do not know when the time will come
It is like a man going on a journey when he leaves home and puts his servants in charge each with his work and commands the doorkeeper to stay awake
Therefore stay awake for you do not know when the master of the house will come in the evening or at midnight or when the rooster crows or in the morning
lest he come suddenly and find you asleep
And what I say to you I say to all Stay awake
