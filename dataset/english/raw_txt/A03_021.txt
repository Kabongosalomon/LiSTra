Leviticus 21
And the LORD said to Moses Speak to the priests the sons of Aaron and say to them No one shall make himself unclean for the dead among his people
except for his closest relatives his mother his father his son his daughter his brother
or his virgin sister who is near to him because she has had no husband for her he may make himself unclean
He shall not make himself unclean as a husband among his people and so profane himself
They shall not make bald patches on their heads nor shave off the edges of their beards nor make any cuts on their body
They shall be holy to their God and not profane the name of their God For they offer the LORD s food offerings the bread of their God therefore they shall be holy
They shall not marry a prostitute or a woman who has been defiled neither shall they marry a woman divorced from her husband for the priest is holy to his God
You shall sanctify him for he offers the bread of your God He shall be holy to you for I the LORD who sanctify you am holy
And the daughter of any priest if she profanes herself by whoring profanes her father she shall be burned with fire
The priest who is chief among his brothers on whose head the anointing oil is poured and who has been consecrated to wear the garments shall not let the hair of his head hang loose nor tear his clothes
He shall not go in to any dead bodies nor make himself unclean even for his father or for his mother
He shall not go out of the sanctuary lest he profane the sanctuary of his God for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is on him I am the LORD
And he shall take a wife in her virginity
A widow or a divorced woman or a woman who has been defiled or a prostitute these he shall not marry But he shall take as his wife a virgin of his own people
that he may not profane his offspring among his people for I am the LORD who sanctifies him
And the LORD spoke to Moses saying
Speak to Aaron saying None of your offspring throughout their generations who has a blemish may approach to offer the bread of his God
For no one who has a blemish shall draw near a man blind or lame or one who has a mutilated face or a limb too long
or a man who has an injured foot or an injured hand
or a hunchback or a dwarf or a man with a defect in his sight or an itching disease or scabs or crushed testicles
No man of the offspring of Aaron the priest who has a blemish shall come near to offer the LORD s food offerings since he has a blemish he shall not come near to offer the bread of his God
He may eat the bread of his God both of the most holy and of the holy things
but he shall not go through the veil or approach the altar because he has a blemish that he may not profane my sanctuaries for I am the LORD who sanctifies them
So Moses spoke to Aaron and to his sons and to all the people of Israel
