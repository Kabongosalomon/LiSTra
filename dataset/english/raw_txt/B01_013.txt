Matthew 13
That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea
And great crowds gathered about him so that he got into a boat and sat down And the whole crowd stood on the beach
And he told them many things in parables saying A sower went out to sow
And as he sowed some seeds fell along the path and the birds came and devoured them
Other seeds fell on rocky ground where they did not have much soil and immediately they sprang up since they had no depth of soil
but when the sun rose they were scorched And since they had no root they withered away
Other seeds fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked them
Other seeds fell on good soil and produced grain some a hundredfold some sixty some thirty
He who has ears let him hear
Then the disciples came and said to him Why do you speak to them in parables
And he answered them To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven but to them it has not been given
For to the one who has more will be given and he will have an abundance but from the one who has not even what he has will be taken away
This is why I speak to them in parables because seeing they do not see and hearing they do not hear nor do they understand
Indeed in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says You will indeed hear but never understand and you will indeed see but never perceive
For this people s heart has grown dull and with their ears they can barely hear and their eyes they have closed lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn and I would heal them
But blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear
For truly I say to you many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see and did not see it and to hear what you hear and did not hear it
Hear then the parable of the sower
When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart This is what was sown along the path
As for what was sown on rocky ground this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy
yet he has no root in himself but endures for a while and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word immediately he falls away
As for what was sown among thorns this is the one who hears the word but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and it proves unfruitful
As for what was sown on good soil this is the one who hears the word and understands it He indeed bears fruit and yields in one case a hundredfold in another sixty and in another thirty
He put another parable before them saying The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field
but while his men were sleeping his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away
So when the plants came up and bore grain then the weeds appeared also
And the servants of the master of the house came and said to him Master did you not sow good seed in your field How then does it have weeds
He said to them An enemy has done this So the servants said to him Then do you want us to go and gather them
But he said No lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat along with them
Let both grow together until the harvest and at harvest time I will tell the reapers Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned but gather the wheat into my barn
He put another parable before them saying The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field
It is the smallest of all seeds but when it has grown it is larger than all the garden plants and becomes a tree so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches
He told them another parable The kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour till it was all leavened
All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables indeed he said nothing to them without a parable
This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet I will open my mouth in parables I will utter what has been hidden since the foundation of the world
Then he left the crowds and went into the house And his disciples came to him saying Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field
He answered The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man
The field is the world and the good seed is the sons of the kingdom The weeds are the sons of the evil one
and the enemy who sowed them is the devil The harvest is the close of the age and the reapers are angels
Just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire so will it be at the close of the age
The Son of Man will send his angels and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all law breakers
and throw them into the fiery furnace In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father He who has ears let him hear
The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field which a man found and covered up Then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field
Again the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls
who on finding one pearl of great value went and sold all that he had and bought it
Again the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind
When it was full men drew it ashore and sat down and sorted the good into containers but threw away the bad
So it will be at the close of the age The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous
and throw them into the fiery furnace In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
Have you understood all these things They said to him Yes
And he said to them Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old
And when Jesus had finished these parables he went away from there
and coming to his hometown he taught them in their synagogue so that they were astonished and said Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works
Is not this the carpenter s son Is not his mother called Mary And are not his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas
And are not all his sisters with us Where then did this man get all these things
And they took offense at him But Jesus said to them A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own household
And he did not do many mighty works there because of their unbelief
