2 Corienthians 6
Working together with him then we appeal to you not to receive the grace of God in vain
For he says In a favorable time I listened to you and in a day of salvation I have helped you Behold now is the favorable time behold now is the day of salvation
We put no obstacle in anyone s way so that no fault may be found with our ministry
but as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way by great endurance in afflictions hardships calamities
beatings imprisonments riots labors sleepless nights hunger
by purity knowledge patience kindness the Holy Spirit genuine love
by truthful speech and the power of God with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left
through honor and dishonor through slander and praise We are treated as impostors and yet are true
as unknown and yet well known as dying and behold we live as punished and yet not killed
as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing yet possessing everything
We have spoken freely to you Corinthians our heart is wide open
You are not restricted by us but you are restricted in your own affections
In return I speak as to children widen your hearts also
Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness Or what fellowship has light with darkness
What accord has Christ with Belial Or what portion does a believer share with an unbeliever
What agreement has the temple of God with idols For we are the temple of the living God as God said I will make my dwelling among them and walk among them and I will be their God and they shall be my people
Therefore go out from their midst and be separate from them says the Lord and touch no unclean thing then I will welcome you
and I will be a father to you and you shall be sons and daughters to me says the Lord Almighty
