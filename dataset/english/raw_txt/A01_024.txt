Genesis 24
Now Abraham was old well advanced in years And the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things
And Abraham said to his servant the oldest of his household who had charge of all that he had Put your hand under my thigh
that I may make you swear by the LORD the God of heaven and God of the earth that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell
but will go to my country and to my kindred and take a wife for my son Isaac
The servant said to him Perhaps the woman may not be willing to follow me to this land Must I then take your son back to the land from which you came
Abraham said to him See to it that you do not take my son back there
The LORD the God of heaven who took me from my father s house and from the land of my kindred and who spoke to me and swore to me To your offspring I will give this land he will send his angel before you and you shall take a wife for my son from there
But if the woman is not willing to follow you then you will be free from this oath of mine only you must not take my son back there
So the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swore to him concerning this matter
Then the servant took ten of his master s camels and departed taking all sorts of choice gifts from his master and he arose and went to Mesopotamia to the city of Nahor
And he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening the time when women go out to draw water
And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham please grant me success today and show steadfast love to my master Abraham
Behold I am standing by the spring of water and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water
Let the young woman to whom I shall say Please let down your jar that I may drink and who shall say Drink and I will water your camels let her be the one whom you have appointed for your servant Isaac By this I shall know that you have shown steadfast love to my master
Before he had finished speaking behold Rebekah who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah the wife of Nahor Abraham s brother came out with her water jar on her shoulder
The young woman was very attractive in appearance a maiden whom no man had known She went down to the spring and filled her jar and came up
Then the servant ran to meet her and said Please give me a little water to drink from your jar
She said Drink my lord And she quickly let down her jar upon her hand and gave him a drink
When she had finished giving him a drink she said I will draw water for your camels also until they have finished drinking
So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough and ran again to the well to draw water and she drew for all his camels
The man gazed at her in silence to learn whether the LORD had prospered his journey or not
When the camels had finished drinking the man took a gold ring weighing a half shekel and two bracelets for her arms weighing ten gold shekels
and said Please tell me whose daughter you are Is there room in your father s house for us to spend the night
She said to him I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah whom she bore to Nahor
She added We have plenty of both straw and fodder and room to spend the night
The man bowed his head and worshiped the LORD
and said Blessed be the LORD the God of my master Abraham who has not forsaken his steadfast love and his faithfulness toward my master As for me the LORD has led me in the way to the house of my master s kinsmen
Then the young woman ran and told her mother s household about these things
Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban Laban ran out toward the man to the spring
As soon as he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister s arms and heard the words of Rebekah his sister Thus the man spoke to me he went to the man And behold he was standing by the camels at the spring
He said Come in O blessed of the LORD Why do you stand outside For I have prepared the house and a place for the camels
So the man came to the house and unharnessed the camels and gave straw and fodder to the camels and there was water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him
Then food was set before him to eat But he said I will not eat until I have said what I have to say He said Speak on
So he said I am Abraham s servant
The LORD has greatly blessed my master and he has become great He has given him flocks and herds silver and gold male servants and female servants camels and donkeys
And Sarah my master s wife bore a son to my master when she was old and to him he has given all that he has
My master made me swear saying You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites in whose land I dwell
but you shall go to my father s house and to my clan and take a wife for my son
I said to my master Perhaps the woman will not follow me
But he said to me The LORD before whom I have walked will send his angel with you and prosper your way You shall take a wife for my son from my clan and from my father s house
Then you will be free from my oath when you come to my clan And if they will not give her to you you will be free from my oath
I came today to the spring and said O LORD the God of my master Abraham if now you are prospering the way that I go
behold I am standing by the spring of water Let the virgin who comes out to draw water to whom I shall say Please give me a little water from your jar to drink
and who will say to me Drink and I will draw for your camels also let her be the woman whom the LORD has appointed for my master s son
Before I had finished speaking in my heart behold Rebekah came out with her water jar on her shoulder and she went down to the spring and drew water I said to her Please let me drink
She quickly let down her jar from her shoulder and said Drink and I will give your camels drink also So I drank and she gave the camels drink also
Then I asked her Whose daughter are you She said The daughter of Bethuel Nahor s son whom Milcah bore to him So I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her arms
Then I bowed my head and worshiped the LORD and blessed the LORD the God of my master Abraham who had led me by the right way to take the daughter of my master s kinsman for his son
Now then if you are going to show steadfast love and faithfulness to my master tell me and if not tell me that I may turn to the right hand or to the left
Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said The thing has come from the LORD we cannot speak to you bad or good
Behold Rebekah is before you take her and go and let her be the wife of your master s son as the LORD has spoken
When Abraham s servant heard their words he bowed himself to the earth before the LORD
And the servant brought out jewelry of silver and of gold and garments and gave them to Rebekah He also gave to her brother and to her mother costly ornaments
And he and the men who were with him ate and drank and they spent the night there When they arose in the morning he said Send me away to my master
Her brother and her mother said Let the young woman remain with us a while at least ten days after that she may go
But he said to them Do not delay me since the LORD has prospered my way Send me away that I may go to my master
They said Let us call the young woman and ask her
And they called Rebekah and said to her Will you go with this man She said I will go
So they sent away Rebekah their sister and her nurse and Abraham s servant and his men
And they blessed Rebekah and said to her Our sister may you become thousands of ten thousands and may your offspring possess the gate of those who hate him
Then Rebekah and her young women arose and rode on the camels and followed the man Thus the servant took Rebekah and went his way
Now Isaac had returned from Beer lahai roi and was dwelling in the Negeb
And Isaac went out to meditate in the field toward evening And he lifted up his eyes and saw and behold there were camels coming
And Rebekah lifted up her eyes and when she saw Isaac she dismounted from the camel
and said to the servant Who is that man walking in the field to meet us The servant said It is my master So she took her veil and covered herself
And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done
Then Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother and took Rebekah and she became his wife and he loved her So Isaac was comforted after his mother s death
