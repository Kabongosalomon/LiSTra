James 5
Come now you rich weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you
Your riches have rotted and your garments are moth eaten
Your gold and silver have corroded and their corrosion will be evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire You have laid up treasure in the last days
Behold the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields which you kept back by fraud are crying out against you and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts
You have lived on the earth in luxury and in self indulgence You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter
You have condemned and murdered the righteous person He does not resist you
Be patient therefore brothers until the coming of the Lord See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth being patient about it until it receives the early and the late rains
You also be patient Establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord is at hand
Do not grumble against one another brothers so that you may not be judged behold the Judge is standing at the door
As an example of suffering and patience brothers take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord
Behold we consider those blessed who remained steadfast You have heard of the steadfastness of Job and you have seen the purpose of the Lord how the Lord is compassionate and merciful
But above all my brothers do not swear either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath but let your yes be yes and your no be no so that you may not fall under condemnation
Is anyone among you suffering Let him pray Is anyone cheerful Let him sing praise
Is anyone among you sick Let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord
And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick and the Lord will raise him up And if he has committed sins he will be forgiven
Therefore confess your sins to one another and pray for one another that you may be healed The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working
Elijah was a man with a nature like ours and he prayed fervently that it might not rain and for three years and six months it did not rain on the earth
Then he prayed again and heaven gave rain and the earth bore its fruit
My brothers if anyone among you wanders from the truth and someone brings him back
let him know that whoever brings back a sinner from his wandering will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins
