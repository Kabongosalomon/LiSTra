Leviticus 9
On the eighth day Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel
and he said to Aaron Take for yourself a bull calf for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering both without blemish and offer them before the LORD
And say to the people of Israel Take a male goat for a sin offering and a calf and a lamb both a year old without blemish for a burnt offering
and an ox and a ram for peace offerings to sacrifice before the LORD and a grain offering mixed with oil for today the LORD will appear to you
And they brought what Moses commanded in front of the tent of meeting and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD
And Moses said This is the thing that the LORD commanded you to do that the glory of the LORD may appear to you
Then Moses said to Aaron Draw near to the altar and offer your sin offering and your burnt offering and make atonement for yourself and for the people and bring the offering of the people and make atonement for them as the LORD has commanded
So Aaron drew near to the altar and killed the calf of the sin offering which was for himself
And the sons of Aaron presented the blood to him and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar and poured out the blood at the base of the altar
But the fat and the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver from the sin offering he burned on the altar as the LORD commanded Moses
The flesh and the skin he burned up with fire outside the camp
Then he killed the burnt offering and Aaron s sons handed him the blood and he threw it against the sides of the altar
And they handed the burnt offering to him piece by piece and the head and he burned them on the altar
And he washed the entrails and the legs and burned them with the burnt offering on the altar
Then he presented the people s offering and took the goat of the sin offering that was for the people and killed it and offered it as a sin offering like the first one
And he presented the burnt offering and offered it according to the rule
And he presented the grain offering took a handful of it and burned it on the altar besides the burnt offering of the morning
Then he killed the ox and the ram the sacrifice of peace offerings for the people And Aaron s sons handed him the blood and he threw it against the sides of the altar
But the fat pieces of the ox and of the ram the fat tail and that which covers the entrails and the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver
they put the fat pieces on the breasts and he burned the fat pieces on the altar
but the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave offering before the LORD as Moses commanded
Then Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them and he came down from offering the sin offering and the burnt offering and the peace offerings
And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting and when they came out they blessed the people and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people
And fire came out from before the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the pieces of fat on the altar and when all the people saw it they shouted and fell on their faces
