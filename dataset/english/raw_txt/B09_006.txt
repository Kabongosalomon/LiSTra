Galathians 6
Brothers if anyone is caught in any transgression you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness Keep watch on yourself lest you too be tempted
Bear one another s burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ
For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing he deceives himself
But let each one test his own work and then his reason to boast will be in himself alone and not in his neighbor
For each will have to bear his own load
One who is taught the word must share all good things with the one who teaches
Do not be deceived God is not mocked for whatever one sows that will he also reap
For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life
And let us not grow weary of doing good for in due season we will reap if we do not give up
So then as we have opportunity let us do good to everyone and especially to those who are of the household of faith
See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand
It is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh who would force you to be circumcised and only in order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ
For even those who are circumcised do not themselves keep the law but they desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh
But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ by which the world has been crucified to me and I to the world
For neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision but a new creation
And as for all who walk by this rule peace and mercy be upon them and upon the Israel of God
From now on let no one cause me trouble for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit brothers Amen
