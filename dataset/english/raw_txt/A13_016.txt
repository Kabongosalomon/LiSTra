1 Chronicles 16
And they brought in the ark of God and set it inside the tent that David had pitched for it and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God
And when David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings he blessed the people in the name of the LORD
and distributed to all Israel both men and women to each a loaf of bread a portion of meat and a cake of raisins
Then he appointed some of the Levites as ministers before the ark of the LORD to invoke to thank and to praise the LORD the God of Israel
Asaph was the chief and second to him were Zechariah Jeiel Shemiramoth Jehiel Mattithiah Eliab Benaiah Obed edom and Jeiel who were to play harps and lyres Asaph was to sound the cymbals
and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests were to blow trumpets regularly before the ark of the covenant of God
Then on that day David first appointed that thanksgiving be sung to the LORD by Asaph and his brothers
Oh give thanks to the LORD call upon his name make known his deeds among the peoples
Sing to him sing praises to him tell of all his wondrous works
Glory in his holy name let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice
Seek the LORD and his strength seek his presence continually
Remember the wondrous works that he has done his miracles and the judgments he uttered
O offspring of Israel his servant sons of Jacob his chosen ones
He is the LORD our God his judgments are in all the earth
Remember his covenant forever the word that he commanded for a thousand generations
the covenant that he made with Abraham his sworn promise to Isaac
which he confirmed as a statute to Jacob as an everlasting covenant to Israel
saying To you I will give the land of Canaan as your portion for an inheritance
When you were few in number and of little account and sojourners in it
wandering from nation to nation from one kingdom to another people
he allowed no one to oppress them he rebuked kings on their account
saying Touch not my anointed ones do my prophets no harm
Sing to the LORD all the earth Tell of his salvation from day to day
Declare his glory among the nations his marvelous works among all the peoples
For great is the LORD and greatly to be praised and he is to be held in awe above all gods
For all the gods of the peoples are idols but the LORD made the heavens
Splendor and majesty are before him strength and joy are in his place
Ascribe to the LORD O clans of the peoples ascribe to the LORD glory and strength
Ascribe to the LORD the glory due his name bring an offering and come before him Worship the LORD in the splendor of holiness
tremble before him all the earth yes the world is established it shall never be moved
Let the heavens be glad and let the earth rejoice and let them say among the nations The LORD reigns
Let the sea roar and all that fills it let the field exult and everything in it
Then shall the trees of the forest sing for joy before the LORD for he comes to judge the earth
Oh give thanks to the LORD for he is good for his steadfast love endures forever
Say also Save us O God of our salvation and gather and deliver us from among the nations that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise
Blessed be the LORD the God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting Then all the people said Amen and praised the LORD
So David left Asaph and his brothers there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD to minister regularly before the ark as each day required
and also Obed edom and his sixty eight brothers while Obed edom the son of Jeduthun and Hosah were to be gatekeepers
And he left Zadok the priest and his brothers the priests before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon
to offer burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of burnt offering regularly morning and evening to do all that is written in the Law of the LORD that he commanded Israel
With them were Heman and Jeduthun and the rest of those chosen and expressly named to give thanks to the LORD for his steadfast love endures forever
Heman and Jeduthun had trumpets and cymbals for the music and instruments for sacred song The sons of Jeduthun were appointed to the gate
Then all the people departed each to his house and David went home to bless his household
