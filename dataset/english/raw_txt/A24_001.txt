Jeremiah 1
The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah one of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin
to whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah in the thirteenth year of his reign
It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah and until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah until the captivity of Jerusalem in the fifth month
Now the word of the LORD came to me saying
Before I formed you in the womb I knew you and before you were born I consecrated you I appointed you a prophet to the nations
Then I said Ah Lord GOD Behold I do not know how to speak for I am only a youth
But the LORD said to me Do not say I am only a youth for to all to whom I send you you shall go and whatever I command you you shall speak
Do not be afraid of them for I am with you to deliver you declares the LORD
Then the LORD put out his hand and touched my mouth And the LORD said to me Behold I have put my words in your mouth
See I have set you this day over nations and over kingdoms to pluck up and to break down to destroy and to overthrow to build and to plant
And the word of the LORD came to me saying Jeremiah what do you see And I said I see an almond branch
Then the LORD said to me You have seen well for I am watching over my word to perform it
The word of the LORD came to me a second time saying What do you see And I said I see a boiling pot facing away from the north
Then the LORD said to me Out of the north disaster shall be let loose upon all the inhabitants of the land
For behold I am calling all the tribes of the kingdoms of the north declares the LORD and they shall come and every one shall set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem against all its walls all around and against all the cities of Judah
And I will declare my judgments against them for all their evil in forsaking me They have made offerings to other gods and worshiped the works of their own hands
But you dress yourself for work arise and say to them everything that I command you Do not be dismayed by them lest I dismay you before them
And I behold I make you this day a fortified city an iron pillar and bronze walls against the whole land against the kings of Judah its officials its priests and the people of the land
They will fight against you but they shall not prevail against you for I am with you declares the LORD to deliver you
