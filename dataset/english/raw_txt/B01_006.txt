Matthew 6
Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven
Thus when you give to the needy sound no trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may be praised by others Truly I say to you they have received their reward
But when you give to the needy do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
so that your giving may be in secret And your Father who sees in secret will reward you
And when you pray you must not be like the hypocrites For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners that they may be seen by others Truly I say to you they have received their reward
But when you pray go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret And your Father who sees in secret will reward you
And when you pray do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do for they think that they will be heard for their many words
Do not be like them for your Father knows what you need before you ask him
Pray then like this Our Father in heaven hallowed be your name
Your kingdom come your will be done on earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors
And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil
For if you forgive others their trespasses your heavenly Father will also forgive you
but if you do not forgive others their trespasses neither will your Father forgive your trespasses
And when you fast do not look gloomy like the hypocrites for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by others Truly I say to you they have received their reward
But when you fast anoint your head and wash your face
that your fasting may not be seen by others but by your Father who is in secret And your Father who sees in secret will reward you
Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal
but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal
For where your treasure is there your heart will be also
The eye is the lamp of the body So if your eye is healthy your whole body will be full of light
but if your eye is bad your whole body will be full of darkness If then the light in you is darkness how great is the darkness
No one can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other You cannot serve God and money
Therefore I tell you do not be anxious about your life what you will eat or what you will drink nor about your body what you will put on Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing
Look at the birds of the air they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns and yet your heavenly Father feeds them Are you not of more value than they
And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life
And why are you anxious about clothing Consider the lilies of the field how they grow they neither toil nor spin
yet I tell you even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these
But if God so clothes the grass of the field which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven will he not much more clothe you O you of little faith
Therefore do not be anxious saying What shall we eat or What shall we drink or What shall we wear
For the Gentiles seek after all these things and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things will be added to you
Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow for tomorrow will be anxious for itself Sufficient for the day is its own trouble
