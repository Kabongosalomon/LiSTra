Genesis 13
So Abram went up from Egypt he and his wife and all that he had and Lot with him into the Negeb
Now Abram was very rich in livestock in silver and in gold
And he journeyed on from the Negeb as far as Bethel to the place where his tent had been at the beginning between Bethel and Ai
to the place where he had made an altar at the first And there Abram called upon the name of the LORD
And Lot who went with Abram also had flocks and herds and tents
so that the land could not support both of them dwelling together for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together
and there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot s livestock At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were dwelling in the land
Then Abram said to Lot Let there be no strife between you and me and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen for we are kinsmen
Is not the whole land before you Separate yourself from me If you take the left hand then I will go to the right or if you take the right hand then I will go to the left
And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw that the Jordan Valley was well watered everywhere like the garden of the LORD like the land of Egypt in the direction of Zoar This was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah
So Lot chose for himself all the Jordan Valley and Lot journeyed east Thus they separated from each other
Abram settled in the land of Canaan while Lot settled among the cities of the valley and moved his tent as far as Sodom
Now the men of Sodom were wicked great sinners against the LORD
The LORD said to Abram after Lot had separated from him Lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are northward and southward and eastward and westward
for all the land that you see I will give to you and to your offspring forever
I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth so that if one can count the dust of the earth your offspring also can be counted
Arise walk through the length and the breadth of the land for I will give it to you
So Abram moved his tent and came and settled by the oaks of Mamre which are at Hebron and there he built an altar to the LORD
