Joel 2
Blow a trumpet in Zion sound an alarm on my holy mountain Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble for the day of the LORD is coming it is near
a day of darkness and gloom a day of clouds and thick darkness Like blackness there is spread upon the mountains a great and powerful people their like has never been before nor will be again after them through the years of all generations
Fire devours before them and behind them a flame burns The land is like the garden of Eden before them but behind them a desolate wilderness and nothing escapes them
Their appearance is like the appearance of horses and like war horses they run
As with the rumbling of chariots they leap on the tops of the mountains like the crackling of a flame of fire devouring the stubble like a powerful army drawn up for battle
Before them peoples are in anguish all faces grow pale
Like warriors they charge like soldiers they scale the wall They march each on his way they do not swerve from their paths
They do not jostle one another each marches in his path they burst through the weapons and are not halted
They leap upon the city they run upon the walls they climb up into the houses they enter through the windows like a thief
The earth quakes before them the heavens tremble The sun and the moon are darkened and the stars withdraw their shining
The LORD utters his voice before his army for his camp is exceedingly great he who executes his word is powerful For the day of the LORD is great and very awesome who can endure it
Yet even now declares the LORD return to me with all your heart with fasting with weeping and with mourning
and rend your hearts and not your garments Return to the LORD your God for he is gracious and merciful slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and he relents over disaster
Who knows whether he will not turn and relent and leave a blessing behind him a grain offering and a drink offering for the LORD your God
Blow the trumpet in Zion consecrate a fast call a solemn assembly
gather the people Consecrate the congregation assemble the elders gather the children even nursing infants Let the bridegroom leave his room and the bride her chamber
Between the vestibule and the altar let the priests the ministers of the LORD weep and say Spare your people O LORD and make not your heritage a reproach a byword among the nations Why should they say among the peoples Where is their God
Then the LORD became jealous for his land and had pity on his people
The LORD answered and said to his people Behold I am sending to you grain wine and oil and you will be satisfied and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations
I will remove the northerner far from you and drive him into a parched and desolate land his vanguard into the eastern sea and his rear guard into the western sea the stench and foul smell of him will rise for he has done great things
Fear not O land be glad and rejoice for the LORD has done great things
Fear not you beasts of the field for the pastures of the wilderness are green the tree bears its fruit the fig tree and vine give their full yield
Be glad O children of Zion and rejoice in the LORD your God for he has given the early rain for your vindication he has poured down for you abundant rain the early and the latter rain as before
The threshing floors shall be full of grain the vats shall overflow with wine and oil
I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten the hopper the destroyer and the cutter my great army which I sent among you
You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the LORD your God who has dealt wondrously with you And my people shall never again be put to shame
You shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the LORD your God and there is none else And my people shall never again be put to shame
And it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions
Even on the male and female servants in those days I will pour out my Spirit
And I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth blood and fire and columns of smoke
The sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the great and awesome day of the LORD comes
And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls on the name of the LORD shall be saved For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those who escape as the LORD has said and among the survivors shall be those whom the LORD calls
