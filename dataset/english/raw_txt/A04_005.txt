Numbers 5
The LORD spoke to Moses saying
Command the people of Israel that they put out of the camp everyone who is leprous or has a discharge and everyone who is unclean through contact with the dead
You shall put out both male and female putting them outside the camp that they may not defile their camp in the midst of which I dwell
And the people of Israel did so and put them outside the camp as the LORD said to Moses so the people of Israel did
And the LORD spoke to Moses saying
Speak to the people of Israel When a man or woman commits any of the sins that people commit by breaking faith with the LORD and that person realizes his guilt
he shall confess his sin that he has committed And he shall make full restitution for his wrong adding a fifth to it and giving it to him to whom he did the wrong
But if the man has no next of kin to whom restitution may be made for the wrong the restitution for wrong shall go to the LORD for the priest in addition to the ram of atonement with which atonement is made for him
And every contribution all the holy donations of the people of Israel which they bring to the priest shall be his
Each one shall keep his holy donations whatever anyone gives to the priest shall be his
And the LORD spoke to Moses saying
Speak to the people of Israel If any man s wife goes astray and breaks faith with him
if a man lies with her sexually and it is hidden from the eyes of her husband and she is undetected though she has defiled herself and there is no witness against her since she was not taken in the act
and if the spirit of jealousy comes over him and he is jealous of his wife who has defiled herself or if the spirit of jealousy comes over him and he is jealous of his wife though she has not defiled herself
then the man shall bring his wife to the priest and bring the offering required of her a tenth of an ephah of barley flour He shall pour no oil on it and put no frankincense on it for it is a grain offering of jealousy a grain offering of remembrance bringing iniquity to remembrance
And the priest shall bring her near and set her before the LORD
And the priest shall take holy water in an earthenware vessel and take some of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle and put it into the water
And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD and unbind the hair of the woman s head and place in her hands the grain offering of remembrance which is the grain offering of jealousy And in his hand the priest shall have the water of bitterness that brings the curse
Then the priest shall make her take an oath saying If no man has lain with you and if you have not turned aside to uncleanness while you were under your husband s authority be free from this water of bitterness that brings the curse
But if you have gone astray though you are under your husband s authority and if you have defiled yourself and some man other than your husband has lain with you
then let the priest make the woman take the oath of the curse and say to the woman the LORD make you a curse and an oath among your people when the LORD makes your thigh fall away and your body swell
May this water that brings the curse pass into your bowels and make your womb swell and your thigh fall away And the woman shall say Amen Amen
Then the priest shall write these curses in a book and wash them off into the water of bitterness
And he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that brings the curse and the water that brings the curse shall enter into her and cause bitter pain
And the priest shall take the grain offering of jealousy out of the woman s hand and shall wave the grain offering before the LORD and bring it to the altar
And the priest shall take a handful of the grain offering as its memorial portion and burn it on the altar and afterward shall make the woman drink the water
And when he has made her drink the water then if she has defiled herself and has broken faith with her husband the water that brings the curse shall enter into her and cause bitter pain and her womb shall swell and her thigh shall fall away and the woman shall become a curse among her people
But if the woman has not defiled herself and is clean then she shall be free and shall conceive children
This is the law in cases of jealousy when a wife though under her husband s authority goes astray and defiles herself
or when the spirit of jealousy comes over a man and he is jealous of his wife Then he shall set the woman before the LORD and the priest shall carry out for her all this law
The man shall be free from iniquity but the woman shall bear her iniquity
