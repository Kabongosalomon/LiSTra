Job 39
Do you know when the mountain goats give birth Do you observe the calving of the does
Can you number the months that they fulfill and do you know the time when they give birth
when they crouch bring forth their offspring and are delivered of their young
Their young ones become strong they grow up in the open they go out and do not return to them
Who has let the wild donkey go free Who has loosed the bonds of the swift donkey
to whom I have given the arid plain for his home and the salt land for his dwelling place
He scorns the tumult of the city he hears not the shouts of the driver
He ranges the mountains as his pasture and he searches after every green thing
Is the wild ox willing to serve you Will he spend the night at your manger
Can you bind him in the furrow with ropes or will he harrow the valleys after you
Will you depend on him because his strength is great and will you leave to him your labor
Do you have faith in him that he will return your grain and gather it to your threshing floor
The wings of the ostrich wave proudly but are they the pinions and plumage of love
For she leaves her eggs to the earth and lets them be warmed on the ground
forgetting that a foot may crush them and that the wild beast may trample them
She deals cruelly with her young as if they were not hers though her labor be in vain yet she has no fear
because God has made her forget wisdom and given her no share in understanding
When she rouses herself to flee she laughs at the horse and his rider
Do you give the horse his might Do you clothe his neck with a mane
Do you make him leap like the locust His majestic snorting is terrifying
He paws in the valley and exults in his strength he goes out to meet the weapons
He laughs at fear and is not dismayed he does not turn back from the sword
Upon him rattle the quiver the flashing spear and the javelin
With fierceness and rage he swallows the ground he cannot stand still at the sound of the trumpet
When the trumpet sounds he says Aha He smells the battle from afar the thunder of the captains and the shouting
Is it by your understanding that the hawk soars and spreads his wings toward the south
Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up and makes his nest on high
On the rock he dwells and makes his home on the rocky crag and stronghold
From there he spies out the prey his eyes behold it from far away
His young ones suck up blood and where the slain are there is he
