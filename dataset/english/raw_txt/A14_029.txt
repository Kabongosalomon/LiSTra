2 Chronicles 29
Hezekiah began to reign when he was twenty five years old and he reigned twenty nine years in Jerusalem His mother s name was Abijah the daughter of Zechariah
And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD according to all that David his father had done
In the first year of his reign in the first month he opened the doors of the house of the LORD and repaired them
He brought in the priests and the Levites and assembled them in the square on the east
and said to them Hear me Levites Now consecrate yourselves and consecrate the house of the LORD the God of your fathers and carry out the filth from the Holy Place
For our fathers have been unfaithful and have done what was evil in the sight of the LORD our God They have forsaken him and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD and turned their backs
They also shut the doors of the vestibule and put out the lamps and have not burned incense or offered burnt offerings in the Holy Place to the God of Israel
Therefore the wrath of the LORD came on Judah and Jerusalem and he has made them an object of horror of astonishment and of hissing as you see with your own eyes
For behold our fathers have fallen by the sword and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this
Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the LORD the God of Israel in order that his fierce anger may turn away from us
My sons do not now be negligent for the LORD has chosen you to stand in his presence to minister to him and to be his ministers and make offerings to him
Then the Levites arose Mahath the son of Amasai and Joel the son of Azariah of the sons of the Kohathites and of the sons of Merari Kish the son of Abdi and Azariah the son of Jehallelel and of the Gershonites Joah the son of Zimmah and Eden the son of Joah
and of the sons of Elizaphan Shimri and Jeuel and of the sons of Asaph Zechariah and Mattaniah
and of the sons of Heman Jehuel and Shimei and of the sons of Jeduthun Shemaiah and Uzziel
They gathered their brothers and consecrated themselves and went in as the king had commanded by the words of the LORD to cleanse the house of the LORD
The priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD to cleanse it and they brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD And the Levites took it and carried it out to the brook Kidron
They began to consecrate on the first day of the first month and on the eighth day of the month they came to the vestibule of the LORD Then for eight days they consecrated the house of the LORD and on the sixteenth day of the first month they finished
Then they went in to Hezekiah the king and said We have cleansed all the house of the LORD the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils and the table for the showbread and all its utensils
All the utensils that King Ahaz discarded in his reign when he was faithless we have made ready and consecrated and behold they are before the altar of the LORD
Then Hezekiah the king rose early and gathered the officials of the city and went up to the house of the LORD
And they brought seven bulls seven rams seven lambs and seven male goats for a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD
So they slaughtered the bulls and the priests received the blood and threw it against the altar And they slaughtered the rams and their blood was thrown against the altar And they slaughtered the lambs and their blood was thrown against the altar
Then the goats for the sin offering were brought to the king and the assembly and they laid their hands on them
and the priests slaughtered them and made a sin offering with their blood on the altar to make atonement for all Israel For the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel
And he stationed the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals harps and lyres according to the commandment of David and of Gad the king s seer and of Nathan the prophet for the commandment was from the LORD through his prophets
The Levites stood with the instruments of David and the priests with the trumpets
Then Hezekiah commanded that the burnt offering be offered on the altar And when the burnt offering began the song to the LORD began also and the trumpets accompanied by the instruments of David king of Israel
The whole assembly worshiped and the singers sang and the trumpeters sounded All this continued until the burnt offering was finished
When the offering was finished the king and all who were present with him bowed themselves and worshiped
And Hezekiah the king and the officials commanded the Levites to sing praises to the LORD with the words of David and of Asaph the seer And they sang praises with gladness and they bowed down and worshiped
Then Hezekiah said You have now consecrated yourselves to the LORD Come near bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the house of the LORD And the assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings and all who were of a willing heart brought burnt offerings
The number of the burnt offerings that the assembly brought was bulls rams and lambs all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD
And the consecrated offerings were bulls and sheep
But the priests were too few and could not flay all the burnt offerings so until other priests had consecrated themselves their brothers the Levites helped them until the work was finished for the Levites were more upright in heart than the priests in consecrating themselves
Besides the great number of burnt offerings there was the fat of the peace offerings and there were the drink offerings for the burnt offerings Thus the service of the house of the LORD was restored
And Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced because God had prepared for the people for the thing came about suddenly
