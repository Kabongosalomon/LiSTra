Luke 17
And he said to his disciples Temptations to sin are sure to come but woe to the one through whom they come
It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were cast into the sea than that he should cause one of these little ones to sin
Pay attention to yourselves If your brother sins rebuke him and if he repents forgive him
and if he sins against you seven times in the day and turns to you seven times saying I repent you must forgive him
The apostles said to the Lord Increase our faith
And the Lord said If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed you could say to this mulberry tree Be uprooted and planted in the sea and it would obey you
Will any one of you who has a servant plowing or keeping sheep say to him when he has come in from the field Come at once and recline at table
Will he not rather say to him Prepare supper for me and dress properly and serve me while I eat and drink and afterward you will eat and drink
Does he thank the servant because he did what was commanded
So you also when you have done all that you were commanded say We are unworthy servants we have only done what was our duty
On the way to Jerusalem he was passing along between Samaria and Galilee
And as he entered a village he was met by ten lepers who stood at a distance
and lifted up their voices saying Jesus Master have mercy on us
When he saw them he said to them Go and show yourselves to the priests And as they went they were cleansed
Then one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back praising God with a loud voice
and he fell on his face at Jesus feet giving him thanks Now he was a Samaritan
Then Jesus answered Were not ten cleansed Where are the nine
Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner
And he said to him Rise and go your way your faith has made you well
Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come he answered them The kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed
nor will they say Look here it is or There for behold the kingdom of God is in the midst of you
And he said to the disciples The days are coming when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man and you will not see it
And they will say to you Look there or Look here Do not go out or follow them
For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other so will the Son of Man be in his day
But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation
Just as it was in the days of Noah so will it be in the days of the Son of Man
They were eating and drinking and marrying and being given in marriage until the day when Noah entered the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all
Likewise just as it was in the days of Lot they were eating and drinking buying and selling planting and building
but on the day when Lot went out from Sodom fire and sulfur rained from heaven and destroyed them all
so will it be on the day when the Son of Man is revealed
On that day let the one who is on the housetop with his goods in the house not come down to take them away and likewise let the one who is in the field not turn back
Remember Lot s wife
Whoever seeks to preserve his life will lose it but whoever loses his life will keep it
I tell you in that night there will be two in one bed One will be taken and the other left
There will be two women grinding together One will be taken and the other left
And they said to him Where Lord He said to them Where the corpse is there the vultures will gather
