Job 26
Then Job answered and said
How you have helped him who has no power How you have saved the arm that has no strength
How you have counseled him who has no wisdom and plentifully declared sound knowledge
With whose help have you uttered words and whose breath has come out from you
The dead tremble under the waters and their inhabitants
Sheol is naked before God and Abaddon has no covering
He stretches out the north over the void and hangs the earth on nothing
He binds up the waters in his thick clouds and the cloud is not split open under them
He covers the face of the full moon and spreads over it his cloud
He has inscribed a circle on the face of the waters at the boundary between light and darkness
The pillars of heaven tremble and are astounded at his rebuke
By his power he stilled the sea by his understanding he shattered Rahab
By his wind the heavens were made fair his hand pierced the fleeing serpent
Behold these are but the outskirts of his ways and how small a whisper do we hear of him But the thunder of his power who can understand
