1 Samuel 16
The LORD said to Samuel How long will you grieve over Saul since I have rejected him from being king over Israel Fill your horn with oil and go I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite for I have provided for myself a king among his sons
And Samuel said How can I go If Saul hears it he will kill me And the LORD said Take a heifer with you and say I have come to sacrifice to the LORD
And invite Jesse to the sacrifice and I will show you what you shall do And you shall anoint for me him whom I declare to you
Samuel did what the LORD commanded and came to Bethlehem The elders of the city came to meet him trembling and said Do you come peaceably
And he said Peaceably I have come to sacrifice to the LORD Consecrate yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice And he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice
When they came he looked on Eliab and thought Surely the LORD s anointed is before him
But the LORD said to Samuel Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature because I have rejected him For the LORD sees not as man sees man looks on the outward appearance but the LORD looks on the heart
Then Jesse called Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel And he said Neither has the LORD chosen this one
Then Jesse made Shammah pass by And he said Neither has the LORD chosen this one
And Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel And Samuel said to Jesse The LORD has not chosen these
Then Samuel said to Jesse Are all your sons here And he said There remains yet the youngest but behold he is keeping the sheep And Samuel said to Jesse Send and get him for we will not sit down till he comes here
And he sent and brought him in Now he was ruddy and had beautiful eyes and was handsome And the LORD said Arise anoint him for this is he
Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers And the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon David from that day forward And Samuel rose up and went to Ramah
Now the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul and a harmful spirit from the LORD tormented him
And Saul s servants said to him Behold now a harmful spirit from God is tormenting you
Let our lord now command your servants who are before you to seek out a man who is skillful in playing the lyre and when the harmful spirit from God is upon you he will play it and you will be well
So Saul said to his servants Provide for me a man who can play well and bring him to me
One of the young men answered Behold I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is skillful in playing a man of valor a man of war prudent in speech and a man of good presence and the LORD is with him
Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said Send me David your son who is with the sheep
And Jesse took a donkey laden with bread and a skin of wine and a young goat and sent them by David his son to Saul
And David came to Saul and entered his service And Saul loved him greatly and he became his armor bearer
And Saul sent to Jesse saying Let David remain in my service for he has found favor in my sight
And whenever the harmful spirit from God was upon Saul David took the lyre and played it with his hand So Saul was refreshed and was well and the harmful spirit departed from him
