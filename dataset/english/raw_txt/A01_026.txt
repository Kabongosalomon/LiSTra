Genesis 26
Now there was a famine in the land besides the former famine that was in the days of Abraham And Isaac went to Gerar to Abimelech king of the Philistines
And the LORD appeared to him and said Do not go down to Egypt dwell in the land of which I shall tell you
Sojourn in this land and I will be with you and will bless you for to you and to your offspring I will give all these lands and I will establish the oath that I swore to Abraham your father
I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and will give to your offspring all these lands And in your offspring all the nations of the earth shall be blessed
because Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge my commandments my statutes and my laws
So Isaac settled in Gerar
When the men of the place asked him about his wife he said She is my sister for he feared to say My wife thinking lest the men of the place should kill me because of Rebekah because she was attractive in appearance
When he had been there a long time Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out of a window and saw Isaac laughing with Rebekah his wife
So Abimelech called Isaac and said Behold she is your wife How then could you say She is my sister Isaac said to him Because I thought Lest I die because of her
Abimelech said What is this you have done to us One of the people might easily have lain with your wife and you would have brought guilt upon us
So Abimelech warned all the people saying Whoever touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death
And Isaac sowed in that land and reaped in the same year a hundredfold The LORD blessed him
and the man became rich and gained more and more until he became very wealthy
He had possessions of flocks and herds and many servants so that the Philistines envied him
Now the Philistines had stopped and filled with earth all the wells that his father s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father
And Abimelech said to Isaac Go away from us for you are much mightier than we
So Isaac departed from there and encamped in the Valley of Gerar and settled there
And Isaac dug again the wells of water that had been dug in the days of Abraham his father which the Philistines had stopped after the death of Abraham And he gave them the names that his father had given them
But when Isaac s servants dug in the valley and found there a well of spring water
the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac s herdsmen saying The water is ours So he called the name of the well Esek because they contended with him
Then they dug another well and they quarreled over that also so he called its name Sitnah
And he moved from there and dug another well and they did not quarrel over it So he called its name Rehoboth saying For now the LORD has made room for us and we shall be fruitful in the land
From there he went up to Beersheba
And the LORD appeared to him the same night and said I am the God of Abraham your father Fear not for I am with you and will bless you and multiply your offspring for my servant Abraham s sake
So he built an altar there and called upon the name of the LORD and pitched his tent there And there Isaac s servants dug a well
When Abimelech went to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his adviser and Phicol the commander of his army
Isaac said to them Why have you come to me seeing that you hate me and have sent me away from you
They said We see plainly that the LORD has been with you So we said let there be a sworn pact between us between you and us and let us make a covenant with you
that you will do us no harm just as we have not touched you and have done to you nothing but good and have sent you away in peace You are now the blessed of the LORD
So he made them a feast and they ate and drank
In the morning they rose early and exchanged oaths And Isaac sent them on their way and they departed from him in peace
That same day Isaac s servants came and told him about the well that they had dug and said to him We have found water
He called it Shibah therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day
When Esau was forty years old he took Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite to be his wife and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite
and they made life bitter for Isaac and Rebekah
