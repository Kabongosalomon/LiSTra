Job 32
So these three men ceased to answer Job because he was righteous in his own eyes
Then Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite of the family of Ram burned with anger He burned with anger at Job because he justified himself rather than God
He burned with anger also at Job s three friends because they had found no answer although they had declared Job to be in the wrong
Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because they were older than he
And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men he burned with anger
And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said I am young in years and you are aged therefore I was timid and afraid to declare my opinion to you
I said Let days speak and many years teach wisdom
But it is the spirit in man the breath of the Almighty that makes him understand
It is not the old who are wise nor the aged who understand what is right
Therefore I say Listen to me let me also declare my opinion
Behold I waited for your words I listened for your wise sayings while you searched out what to say
I gave you my attention and behold there was none among you who refuted Job or who answered his words
Beware lest you say We have found wisdom God may vanquish him not a man
He has not directed his words against me and I will not answer him with your speeches
They are dismayed they answer no more they have not a word to say
And shall I wait because they do not speak because they stand there and answer no more
I also will answer with my share I also will declare my opinion
For I am full of words the spirit within me constrains me
Behold my belly is like wine that has no vent like new wineskins ready to burst
I must speak that I may find relief I must open my lips and answer
I will not show partiality to any man or use flattery toward any person
For I do not know how to flatter else my Maker would soon take me away
