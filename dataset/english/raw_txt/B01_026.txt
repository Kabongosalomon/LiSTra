Matthew 26
When Jesus had finished all these sayings he said to his disciples
You know that after two days the Passover is coming and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the palace of the high priest whose name was Caiaphas
and plotted together in order to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him
But they said Not during the feast lest there be an uproar among the people
Now when Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper
a woman came up to him with an alabaster flask of very expensive ointment and she poured it on his head as he reclined at table
And when the disciples saw it they were indignant saying Why this waste
For this could have been sold for a large sum and given to the poor
But Jesus aware of this said to them Why do you trouble the woman For she has done a beautiful thing to me
For you always have the poor with you but you will not always have me
In pouring this ointment on my body she has done it to prepare me for burial
Truly I say to you wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world what she has done will also be told in memory of her
Then one of the twelve whose name was Judas Iscariot went to the chief priests
and said What will you give me if I deliver him over to you And they paid him thirty pieces of silver
And from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray him
Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus saying Where will you have us prepare for you to eat the Passover
He said Go into the city to a certain man and say to him The Teacher says My time is at hand I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples
And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and they prepared the Passover
When it was evening he reclined at table with the twelve
And as they were eating he said Truly I say to you one of you will betray me
And they were very sorrowful and began to say to him one after another Is it I Lord
He answered He who has dipped his hand in the dish with me will betray me
The Son of Man goes as it is written of him but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed It would have been better for that man if he had not been born
Judas who would betray him answered Is it I Rabbi He said to him You have said so
Now as they were eating Jesus took bread and after blessing it broke it and gave it to the disciples and said Take eat this is my body
And he took a cup and when he had given thanks he gave it to them saying Drink of it all of you
for this is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins
I tell you I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father s kingdom
And when they had sung a hymn they went out to the Mount of Olives
Then Jesus said to them You will all fall away because of me this night For it is written I will strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered
But after I am raised up I will go before you to Galilee
Peter answered him Though they all fall away because of you I will never fall away
Jesus said to him Truly I tell you this very night before the rooster crows you will deny me three times
Peter said to him Even if I must die with you I will not deny you And all the disciples said the same
Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane and he said to his disciples Sit here while I go over there and pray
And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee he began to be sorrowful and troubled
Then he said to them My soul is very sorrowful even to death remain here and watch with me
And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed saying My Father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as I will but as you will
And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping And he said to Peter So could you not watch with me one hour
Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation The spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak
Again for the second time he went away and prayed My Father if this cannot pass unless I drink it your will be done
And again he came and found them sleeping for their eyes were heavy
So leaving them again he went away and prayed for the third time saying the same words again
Then he came to the disciples and said to them Sleep and take your rest later on See the hour is at hand and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners
Rise let us be going see my betrayer is at hand
While he was still speaking Judas came one of the twelve and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs from the chief priests and the elders of the people
Now the betrayer had given them a sign saying The one I will kiss is the man seize him
And he came up to Jesus at once and said Greetings Rabbi And he kissed him
Jesus said to him Friend do what you came to do Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him
And behold one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear
Then Jesus said to him Put your sword back into its place For all who take the sword will perish by the sword
Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels
But how then should the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so
At that hour Jesus said to the crowds Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to capture me Day after day I sat in the temple teaching and you did not seize me
But all this has taken place that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled Then all the disciples left him and fled
Then those who had seized Jesus led him to Caiaphas the high priest where the scribes and the elders had gathered
And Peter was following him at a distance as far as the courtyard of the high priest and going inside he sat with the guards to see the end
Now the chief priests and the whole Council were seeking false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death
but they found none though many false witnesses came forward At last two came forward
and said This man said I am able to destroy the temple of God and to rebuild it in three days
And the high priest stood up and said Have you no answer to make What is it that these men testify against you
But Jesus remained silent And the high priest said to him I adjure you by the living God tell us if you are the Christ the Son of God
Jesus said to him You have said so But I tell you from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven
Then the high priest tore his robes and said He has uttered blasphemy What further witnesses do we need You have now heard his blasphemy
What is your judgment They answered He deserves death
Then they spit in his face and struck him And some slapped him
saying Prophesy to us you Christ Who is it that struck you
Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard And a servant girl came up to him and said You also were with Jesus the Galilean
But he denied it before them all saying I do not know what you mean
And when he went out to the entrance another servant girl saw him and she said to the bystanders This man was with Jesus of Nazareth
And again he denied it with an oath I do not know the man
After a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter Certainly you too are one of them for your accent betrays you
Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear I do not know the man And immediately the rooster crowed
And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times And he went out and wept bitterly
