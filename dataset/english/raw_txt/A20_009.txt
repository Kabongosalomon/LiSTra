Proverbs 9
Wisdom has built her house she has hewn her seven pillars
She has slaughtered her beasts she has mixed her wine she has also set her table
She has sent out her young women to call from the highest places in the town
Whoever is simple let him turn in here To him who lacks sense she says
Come eat of my bread and drink of the wine I have mixed
Leave your simple ways and live and walk in the way of insight
Whoever corrects a scoffer gets himself abuse and he who reproves a wicked man incurs injury
Do not reprove a scoffer or he will hate you reprove a wise man and he will love you
Give instruction to a wise man and he will be still wiser teach a righteous man and he will increase in learning
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight
For by me your days will be multiplied and years will be added to your life
If you are wise you are wise for yourself if you scoff you alone will bear it
The woman Folly is loud she is seductive and knows nothing
She sits at the door of her house she takes a seat on the highest places of the town
calling to those who pass by who are going straight on their way
Whoever is simple let him turn in here And to him who lacks sense she says
Stolen water is sweet and bread eaten in secret is pleasant
But he does not know that the dead are there that her guests are in the depths of Sheol
