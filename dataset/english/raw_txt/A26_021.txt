Ezekiel 21
The word of the LORD came to me
Son of man set your face toward Jerusalem and preach against the sanctuaries Prophesy against the land of Israel
and say to the land of Israel Thus says the LORD Behold I am against you and will draw my sword from its sheath and will cut off from you both righteous and wicked
Because I will cut off from you both righteous and wicked therefore my sword shall be drawn from its sheath against all flesh from south to north
And all flesh shall know that I am the LORD I have drawn my sword from its sheath it shall not be sheathed again
As for you son of man groan with breaking heart and bitter grief groan before their eyes
And when they say to you Why do you groan you shall say Because of the news that it is coming Every heart will melt and all hands will be feeble every spirit will faint and all knees will be weak as water Behold it is coming and it will be fulfilled declares the Lord GOD
And the word of the LORD came to me
Son of man prophesy and say Thus says the Lord say A sword a sword is sharpened and also polished
sharpened for slaughter polished to flash like lightning Or shall we rejoice You have despised the rod my son with everything of wood
So the sword is given to be polished that it may be grasped in the hand It is sharpened and polished to be given into the hand of the slayer
Cry out and wail son of man for it is against my people It is against all the princes of Israel They are delivered over to the sword with my people Strike therefore upon your thigh
For it will not be a testing what could it do if you despise the rod declares the Lord GOD
As for you son of man prophesy Clap your hands and let the sword come down twice yes three times the sword for those to be slain It is the sword for the great slaughter which surrounds them
that their hearts may melt and many stumble At all their gates I have given the glittering sword Ah it is made like lightning it is taken up for slaughter
Cut sharply to the right set yourself to the left wherever your face is directed
I also will clap my hands and I will satisfy my fury I the LORD have spoken
The word of the LORD came to me again
As for you son of man mark two ways for the sword of the king of Babylon to come Both of them shall come from the same land And make a signpost make it at the head of the way to a city
Mark a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the Ammonites and to Judah into Jerusalem the fortified
For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the way at the head of the two ways to use divination He shakes the arrows he consults the teraphim he looks at the liver
Into his right hand comes the divination for Jerusalem to set battering rams to open the mouth with murder to lift up the voice with shouting to set battering rams against the gates to cast up mounds to build siege towers
But to them it will seem like a false divination They have sworn solemn oaths but he brings their guilt to remembrance that they may be taken
Therefore thus says the Lord GOD Because you have made your guilt to be remembered in that your transgressions are uncovered so that in all your deeds your sins appear because you have come to remembrance you shall be taken in hand
And you O profane wicked one prince of Israel whose day has come the time of your final punishment
thus says the Lord GOD Remove the turban and take off the crown Things shall not remain as they are Exalt that which is low and bring low that which is exalted
A ruin ruin ruin I will make it This also shall not be until he comes the one to whom judgment belongs and I will give it to him
And you son of man prophesy and say Thus says the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites and concerning their reproach say A sword a sword is drawn for the slaughter It is polished to consume and to flash like lightning
while they see for you false visions while they divine lies for you to place you on the necks of the profane wicked whose day has come the time of their final punishment
Return it to its sheath In the place where you were created in the land of your origin I will judge you
And I will pour out my indignation upon you I will blow upon you with the fire of my wrath and I will deliver you into the hands of brutish men skillful to destroy
You shall be fuel for the fire Your blood shall be in the midst of the land You shall be no more remembered for I the LORD have spoken
