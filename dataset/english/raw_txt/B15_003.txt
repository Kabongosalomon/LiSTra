1 Timothy 3
The saying is trustworthy If anyone aspires to the office of overseer he desires a noble task
Therefore an overseer must be above reproach the husband of one wife sober minded self controlled respectable hospitable able to teach
not a drunkard not violent but gentle not quarrelsome not a lover of money
He must manage his own household well with all dignity keeping his children submissive
for if someone does not know how to manage his own household how will he care for God s church
He must not be a recent convert or he may become puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil
Moreover he must be well thought of by outsiders so that he may not fall into disgrace into a snare of the devil
Deacons likewise must be dignified not double tongued not addicted to much wine not greedy for dishonest gain
They must hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience
And let them also be tested first then let them serve as deacons if they prove themselves blameless
Their wives likewise must be dignified not slanderers but sober minded faithful in all things
Let deacons each be the husband of one wife managing their children and their own households well
For those who serve well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves and also great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus
I hope to come to you soon but I am writing these things to you so that
if I delay you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God which is the church of the living God a pillar and buttress of the truth
Great indeed we confess is the mystery of godliness He was manifested in the flesh vindicated by the Spirit seen by angels proclaimed among the nations believed on in the world taken up in glory
