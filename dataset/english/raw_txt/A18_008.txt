Job 8
Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said
How long will you say these things and the words of your mouth be a great wind
Does God pervert justice Or does the Almighty pervert the right
If your children have sinned against him he has delivered them into the hand of their transgression
If you will seek God and plead with the Almighty for mercy
if you are pure and upright surely then he will rouse himself for you and restore your rightful habitation
And though your beginning was small your latter days will be very great
For inquire please of bygone ages and consider what the fathers have searched out
For we are but of yesterday and know nothing for our days on earth are a shadow
Will they not teach you and tell you and utter words out of their understanding
Can papyrus grow where there is no marsh Can reeds flourish where there is no water
While yet in flower and not cut down they wither before any other plant
Such are the paths of all who forget God the hope of the godless shall perish
His confidence is severed and his trust is a spider s web
He leans against his house but it does not stand he lays hold of it but it does not endure
He is a lush plant before the sun and his shoots spread over his garden
His roots entwine the stone heap he looks upon a house of stones
If he is destroyed from his place then it will deny him saying I have never seen you
Behold this is the joy of his way and out of the soil others will spring
Behold God will not reject a blameless man nor take the hand of evildoers
He will yet fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with shouting
Those who hate you will be clothed with shame and the tent of the wicked will be no more
