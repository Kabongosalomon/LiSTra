Isaiah 10
Woe to those who decree iniquitous decrees and the writers who keep writing oppression
to turn aside the needy from justice and to rob the poor of my people of their right that widows may be their spoil and that they may make the fatherless their prey
What will you do on the day of punishment in the ruin that will come from afar To whom will you flee for help and where will you leave your wealth
Nothing remains but to crouch among the prisoners or fall among the slain For all this his anger has not turned away and his hand is stretched out still
Ah Assyria the rod of my anger the staff in their hands is my fury
Against a godless nation I send him and against the people of my wrath I command him to take spoil and seize plunder and to tread them down like the mire of the streets
But he does not so intend and his heart does not so think but it is in his heart to destroy and to cut off nations not a few
for he says Are not my commanders all kings
Is not Calno like Carchemish Is not Hamath like Arpad Is not Samaria like Damascus
As my hand has reached to the kingdoms of the idols whose carved images were greater than those of Jerusalem and Samaria
shall I not do to Jerusalem and her idols as I have done to Samaria and her images
When the Lord has finished all his work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem he will punish the speech of the arrogant heart of the king of Assyria and the boastful look in his eyes
For he says By the strength of my hand I have done it and by my wisdom for I have understanding I remove the boundaries of peoples and plunder their treasures like a bull I bring down those who sit on thrones
My hand has found like a nest the wealth of the peoples and as one gathers eggs that have been forsaken so I have gathered all the earth and there was none that moved a wing or opened the mouth or chirped
Shall the axe boast over him who hews with it or the saw magnify itself against him who wields it As if a rod should wield him who lifts it or as if a staff should lift him who is not wood
Therefore the Lord GOD of hosts will send wasting sickness among his stout warriors and under his glory a burning will be kindled like the burning of fire
The light of Israel will become a fire and his Holy One a flame and it will burn and devour his thorns and briers in one day
The glory of his forest and of his fruitful land the LORD will destroy both soul and body and it will be as when a sick man wastes away
The remnant of the trees of his forest will be so few that a child can write them down
In that day the remnant of Israel and the survivors of the house of Jacob will no more lean on him who struck them but will lean on the LORD the Holy One of Israel in truth
A remnant will return the remnant of Jacob to the mighty God
For though your people Israel be as the sand of the sea only a remnant of them will return Destruction is decreed overflowing with righteousness
For the Lord GOD of hosts will make a full end as decreed in the midst of all the earth
Therefore thus says the Lord GOD of hosts O my people who dwell in Zion be not afraid of the Assyrians when they strike with the rod and lift up their staff against you as the Egyptians did
For in a very little while my fury will come to an end and my anger will be directed to their destruction
And the LORD of hosts will wield against them a whip as when he struck Midian at the rock of Oreb And his staff will be over the sea and he will lift it as he did in Egypt
And in that day his burden will depart from your shoulder and his yoke from your neck and the yoke will be broken because of the fat
He has come to Aiath he has passed through Migron at Michmash he stores his baggage
they have crossed over the pass at Geba they lodge for the night Ramah trembles Gibeah of Saul has fled
Cry aloud O daughter of Gallim Give attention O Laishah O poor Anathoth
Madmenah is in flight the inhabitants of Gebim flee for safety
This very day he will halt at Nob he will shake his fist at the mount of the daughter of Zion the hill of Jerusalem
Behold the Lord GOD of hosts will lop the boughs with terrifying power the great in height will be hewn down and the lofty will be brought low
He will cut down the thickets of the forest with an axe and Lebanon will fall by the Majestic One
