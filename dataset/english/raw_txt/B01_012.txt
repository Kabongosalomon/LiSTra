Matthew 12
At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath His disciples were hungry and they began to pluck heads of grain and to eat
But when the Pharisees saw it they said to him Look your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath
He said to them Have you not read what David did when he was hungry and those who were with him
how he entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence which it was not lawful for him to eat nor for those who were with him but only for the priests
Or have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless
I tell you something greater than the temple is here
And if you had known what this means I desire mercy and not sacrifice you would not have condemned the guiltless
For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath
He went on from there and entered their synagogue
And a man was there with a withered hand And they asked him Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath so that they might accuse him
He said to them Which one of you who has a sheep if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath will not take hold of it and lift it out
Of how much more value is a man than a sheep So it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath
Then he said to the man Stretch out your hand And the man stretched it out and it was restored healthy like the other
But the Pharisees went out and conspired against him how to destroy him
Jesus aware of this withdrew from there And many followed him and he healed them all
and ordered them not to make him known
This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah
Behold my servant whom I have chosen my beloved with whom my soul is well pleased I will put my Spirit upon him and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles
He will not quarrel or cry aloud nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets
a bruised reed he will not break and a smoldering wick he will not quench until he brings justice to victory
and in his name the Gentiles will hope
Then a demon oppressed man who was blind and mute was brought to him and he healed him so that the man spoke and saw
And all the people were amazed and said Can this be the Son of David
But when the Pharisees heard it they said It is only by Beelzebul the prince of demons that this man casts out demons
Knowing their thoughts he said to them Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste and no city or house divided against itself will stand
And if Satan casts out Satan he is divided against himself How then will his kingdom stand
And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul by whom do your sons cast them out Therefore they will be your judges
But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons then the kingdom of God has come upon you
Or how can someone enter a strong man s house and plunder his goods unless he first binds the strong man Then indeed he may plunder his house
Whoever is not with me is against me and whoever does not gather with me scatters
Therefore I tell you every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven
And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven either in this age or in the age to come
Either make the tree good and its fruit good or make the tree bad and its fruit bad for the tree is known by its fruit
You brood of vipers How can you speak good when you are evil For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks
The good person out of his good treasure brings forth good and the evil person out of his evil treasure brings forth evil
I tell you on the day of judgment people will give account for every careless word they speak
for by your words you will be justified and by your words you will be condemned
Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him saying Teacher we wish to see a sign from you
But he answered them An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah
For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth
The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it for they repented at the preaching of Jonah and behold something greater than Jonah is here
The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold something greater than Solomon is here
When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person it passes through waterless places seeking rest but finds none
Then it says I will return to my house from which I came And when it comes it finds the house empty swept and put in order
Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself and they enter and dwell there and the last state of that person is worse than the first So also will it be with this evil generation
While he was still speaking to the people behold his mother and his brothers stood outside asking to speak to him
But he replied to the man who told him Who is my mother and who are my brothers
And stretching out his hand toward his disciples he said Here are my mother and my brothers
For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother
