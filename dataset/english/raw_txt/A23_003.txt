Isaiah 3
For behold the Lord GOD of hosts is taking away from Jerusalem and from Judah support and supply all support of bread and all support of water
the mighty man and the soldier the judge and the prophet the diviner and the elder
the captain of fifty and the man of rank the counselor and the skillful magician and the expert in charms
And I will make boys their princes and infants shall rule over them
And the people will oppress one another every one his fellow and every one his neighbor the youth will be insolent to the elder and the despised to the honorable
For a man will take hold of his brother in the house of his father saying You have a cloak you shall be our leader and this heap of ruins shall be under your rule
in that day he will speak out saying I will not be a healer in my house there is neither bread nor cloak you shall not make me leader of the people
For Jerusalem has stumbled and Judah has fallen because their speech and their deeds are against the LORD defying his glorious presence
For the look on their faces bears witness against them they proclaim their sin like Sodom they do not hide it Woe to them For they have brought evil on themselves
Tell the righteous that it shall be well with them for they shall eat the fruit of their deeds
Woe to the wicked It shall be ill with him for what his hands have dealt out shall be done to him
My people infants are their oppressors and women rule over them O my people your guides mislead you and they have swallowed up the course of your paths
The LORD has taken his place to contend he stands to judge peoples
The LORD will enter into judgment with the elders and princes of his people It is you who have devoured the vineyard the spoil of the poor is in your houses
What do you mean by crushing my people by grinding the face of the poor declares the Lord GOD of hosts
The LORD said Because the daughters of Zion are haughty and walk with outstretched necks glancing wantonly with their eyes mincing along as they go tinkling with their feet
therefore the Lord will strike with a scab the heads of the daughters of Zion and the LORD will lay bare their secret parts
In that day the Lord will take away the finery of the anklets the headbands and the crescents
the pendants the bracelets and the scarves
the headdresses the armlets the sashes the perfume boxes and the amulets
the signet rings and nose rings
the festal robes the mantles the cloaks and the handbags
the mirrors the linen garments the turbans and the veils
Instead of perfume there will be rottenness and instead of a belt a rope and instead of well set hair baldness and instead of a rich robe a skirt of sackcloth and branding instead of beauty
Your men shall fall by the sword and your mighty men in battle
And her gates shall lament and mourn empty she shall sit on the ground
