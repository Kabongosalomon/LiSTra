Romans 6
What shall we say then Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound
By no means How can we who died to sin still live in it
Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death
We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father we too might walk in newness of life
For if we have been united with him in a death like his we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his
We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin
For one who has died has been set free from sin
Now if we have died with Christ we believe that we will also live with him
We know that Christ being raised from the dead will never die again death no longer has dominion over him
For the death he died he died to sin once for all but the life he lives he lives to God
So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus
Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body to make you obey its passions
Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life and your members to God as instruments for righteousness
For sin will have no dominion over you since you are not under law but under grace
What then Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace By no means
Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves you are slaves of the one whom you obey either of sin which leads to death or of obedience which leads to righteousness
But thanks be to God that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed
and having been set free from sin have become slaves of righteousness
I am speaking in human terms because of your natural limitations For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification
For when you were slaves of sin you were free in regard to righteousness
But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed For the end of those things is death
But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end eternal life
For the wages of sin is death but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord
