Zechariah 6
Again I lifted my eyes and saw and behold four chariots came out from between two mountains And the mountains were mountains of bronze
The first chariot had red horses the second black horses
the third white horses and the fourth chariot dappled horses all of them strong
Then I answered and said to the angel who talked with me What are these my lord
And the angel answered and said to me These are going out to the four winds of heaven after presenting themselves before the LORD of all the earth
The chariot with the black horses goes toward the north country the white ones go after them and the dappled ones go toward the south country
When the strong horses came out they were impatient to go and patrol the earth And he said Go patrol the earth So they patrolled the earth
Then he cried to me Behold those who go toward the north country have set my Spirit at rest in the north country
And the word of the LORD came to me
Take from the exiles Heldai Tobijah and Jedaiah who have arrived from Babylon and go the same day to the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah
Take from them silver and gold and make a crown and set it on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak the high priest
And say to him Thus says the LORD of hosts Behold the man whose name is the Branch for he shall branch out from his place and he shall build the temple of the LORD
It is he who shall build the temple of the LORD and shall bear royal honor and shall sit and rule on his throne And there shall be a priest on his throne and the counsel of peace shall be between them both
And the crown shall be in the temple of the LORD as a reminder to Helem Tobijah Jedaiah and Hen the son of Zephaniah
And those who are far off shall come and help to build the temple of the LORD And you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you And this shall come to pass if you will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God
