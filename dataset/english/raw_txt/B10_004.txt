Ephesians 4
I therefore a prisoner for the Lord urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called
with all humility and gentleness with patience bearing with one another in love
eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace
There is one body and one Spirit just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your call
one Lord one faith one baptism
one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all
But grace was given to each one of us according to the measure of Christ s gift
Therefore it says When he ascended on high he led a host of captives and he gave gifts to men
In saying He ascended what does it mean but that he had also descended into the lower regions the earth
He who descended is the one who also ascended far above all the heavens that he might fill all things
And he gave the apostles the prophets the evangelists the shepherds and teachers
to equip the saints for the work of ministry for building up the body of Christ
until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God to mature manhood to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
so that we may no longer be children tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine by human cunning by craftiness in deceitful schemes
Rather speaking the truth in love we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head into Christ
from whom the whole body joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped when each part is working properly makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love
Now this I say and testify in the Lord that you must no longer walk as the Gentiles do in the futility of their minds
They are darkened in their understanding alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to their hardness of heart
They have become callous and have given themselves up to sensuality greedy to practice every kind of impurity
But that is not the way you learned Christ
assuming that you have heard about him and were taught in him as the truth is in Jesus
to put off your old self which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful desires
and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds
and to put on the new self created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness
Therefore having put away falsehood let each one of you speak the truth with his neighbor for we are members one of another
Be angry and do not sin do not let the sun go down on your anger
and give no opportunity to the devil
Let the thief no longer steal but rather let him labor doing honest work with his own hands so that he may have something to share with anyone in need
Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths but only such as is good for building up as fits the occasion that it may give grace to those who hear
And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption
Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you along with all malice
Be kind to one another tenderhearted forgiving one another as God in Christ forgave you
