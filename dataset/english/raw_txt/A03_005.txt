Leviticus 5
If anyone sins in that he hears a public adjuration to testify and though he is a witness whether he has seen or come to know the matter yet does not speak he shall bear his iniquity
or if anyone touches an unclean thing whether a carcass of an unclean wild animal or a carcass of unclean livestock or a carcass of unclean swarming things and it is hidden from him and he has become unclean and he realizes his guilt
or if he touches human uncleanness of whatever sort the uncleanness may be with which one becomes unclean and it is hidden from him when he comes to know it and realizes his guilt
or if anyone utters with his lips a rash oath to do evil or to do good any sort of rash oath that people swear and it is hidden from him when he comes to know it and he realizes his guilt in any of these
when he realizes his guilt in any of these and confesses the sin he has committed
he shall bring to the LORD as his compensation for the sin that he has committed a female from the flock a lamb or a goat for a sin offering And the priest shall make atonement for him for his sin
But if he cannot afford a lamb then he shall bring to the LORD as his compensation for the sin that he has committed two turtledoves or two pigeons one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering
He shall bring them to the priest who shall offer first the one for the sin offering He shall wring its head from its neck but shall not sever it completely
and he shall sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar while the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar it is a sin offering
Then he shall offer the second for a burnt offering according to the rule And the priest shall make atonement for him for the sin that he has committed and he shall be forgiven
But if he cannot afford two turtledoves or two pigeons then he shall bring as his offering for the sin that he has committed a tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering He shall put no oil on it and shall put no frankincense on it for it is a sin offering
And he shall bring it to the priest and the priest shall take a handful of it as its memorial portion and burn this on the altar on the LORD s food offerings it is a sin offering
Thus the priest shall make atonement for him for the sin which he has committed in any one of these things and he shall be forgiven And the remainder shall be for the priest as in the grain offering
The LORD spoke to Moses saying
If anyone commits a breach of faith and sins unintentionally in any of the holy things of the LORD he shall bring to the LORD as his compensation a ram without blemish out of the flock valued in silver shekels according to the shekel of the sanctuary for a guilt offering
He shall also make restitution for what he has done amiss in the holy thing and shall add a fifth to it and give it to the priest And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering and he shall be forgiven
If anyone sins doing any of the things that by the LORD s commandments ought not to be done though he did not know it then realizes his guilt he shall bear his iniquity
He shall bring to the priest a ram without blemish out of the flock or its equivalent for a guilt offering and the priest shall make atonement for him for the mistake that he made unintentionally and he shall be forgiven
It is a guilt offering he has indeed incurred guilt before the LORD
