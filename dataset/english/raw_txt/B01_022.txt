Matthew 22
And again Jesus spoke to them in parables saying
The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son
and sent his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast but they would not come
Again he sent other servants saying Tell those who are invited See I have prepared my dinner my oxen and my fat calves have been slaughtered and everything is ready Come to the wedding feast
But they paid no attention and went off one to his farm another to his business
while the rest seized his servants treated them shamefully and killed them
The king was angry and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city
Then he said to his servants The wedding feast is ready but those invited were not worthy
Go therefore to the main roads and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find
And those servants went out into the roads and gathered all whom they found both bad and good So the wedding hall was filled with guests
But when the king came in to look at the guests he saw there a man who had no wedding garment
And he said to him Friend how did you get in here without a wedding garment And he was speechless
Then the king said to the attendants Bind him hand and foot and cast him into the outer darkness In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
For many are called but few are chosen
Then the Pharisees went and plotted how to entangle him in his words
And they sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians saying Teacher we know that you are true and teach the way of God truthfully and you do not care about anyone s opinion for you are not swayed by appearances
Tell us then what you think Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not
But Jesus aware of their malice said Why put me to the test you hypocrites
Show me the coin for the tax And they brought him a denarius
And Jesus said to them Whose likeness and inscription is this
They said Caesar s Then he said to them Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar s and to God the things that are God s
When they heard it they marveled And they left him and went away
The same day Sadducees came to him who say that there is no resurrection and they asked him a question
saying Teacher Moses said If a man dies having no children his brother must marry the widow and raise up children for his brother
Now there were seven brothers among us The first married and died and having no children left his wife to his brother
So too the second and third down to the seventh
After them all the woman died
In the resurrection therefore of the seven whose wife will she be For they all had her
But Jesus answered them You are wrong because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God
For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are like angels in heaven
And as for the resurrection of the dead have you not read what was said to you by God
I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob He is not God of the dead but of the living
And when the crowd heard it they were astonished at his teaching
But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees they gathered together
And one of them a lawyer asked him a question to test him
Teacher which is the great commandment in the Law
And he said to him You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind
This is the great and first commandment
And a second is like it You shall love your neighbor as yourself
On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets
Now while the Pharisees were gathered together Jesus asked them a question
saying What do you think about the Christ Whose son is he They said to him The son of David
He said to them How is it then that David in the Spirit calls him Lord saying
The Lord said to my Lord Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet
If then David calls him Lord how is he his son
And no one was able to answer him a word nor from that day did anyone dare to ask him any more questions
