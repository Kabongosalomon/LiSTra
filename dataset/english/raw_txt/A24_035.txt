Jeremiah 35
The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah
Go to the house of the Rechabites and speak with them and bring them to the house of the LORD into one of the chambers then offer them wine to drink
So I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah son of Habazziniah and his brothers and all his sons and the whole house of the Rechabites
I brought them to the house of the LORD into the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah the man of God which was near the chamber of the officials above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum keeper of the threshold
Then I set before the Rechabites pitchers full of wine and cups and I said to them Drink wine
But they answered We will drink no wine for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us You shall not drink wine neither you nor your sons forever
You shall not build a house you shall not sow seed you shall not plant or have a vineyard but you shall live in tents all your days that you may live many days in the land where you sojourn
We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he commanded us to drink no wine all our days ourselves our wives our sons or our daughters
and not to build houses to dwell in We have no vineyard or field or seed
but we have lived in tents and have obeyed and done all that Jonadab our father commanded us
But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against the land we said Come and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans and the army of the Syrians So we are living in Jerusalem
Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah
Thus says the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Go and say to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem Will you not receive instruction and listen to my words declares the LORD
The command that Jonadab the son of Rechab gave to his sons to drink no wine has been kept and they drink none to this day for they have obeyed their father s command I have spoken to you persistently but you have not listened to me
I have sent to you all my servants the prophets sending them persistently saying Turn now every one of you from his evil way and amend your deeds and do not go after other gods to serve them and then you shall dwell in the land that I gave to you and your fathers But you did not incline your ear or listen to me
The sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have kept the command that their father gave them but this people has not obeyed me
Therefore thus says the LORD the God of hosts the God of Israel Behold I am bringing upon Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the disaster that I have pronounced against them because I have spoken to them and they have not listened I have called to them and they have not answered
But to the house of the Rechabites Jeremiah said Thus says the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Because you have obeyed the command of Jonadab your father and kept all his precepts and done all that he commanded you
therefore thus says the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Jonadab the son of Rechab shall never lack a man to stand before me
