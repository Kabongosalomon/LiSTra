Ezra 3
When the seventh month came and the children of Israel were in the towns the people gathered as one man to Jerusalem
Then arose Jeshua the son of Jozadak with his fellow priests and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel with his kinsmen and they built the altar of the God of Israel to offer burnt offerings on it as it is written in the Law of Moses the man of God
They set the altar in its place for fear was on them because of the peoples of the lands and they offered burnt offerings on it to the LORD burnt offerings morning and evening
And they kept the Feast of Booths as it is written and offered the daily burnt offerings by number according to the rule as each day required
and after that the regular burnt offerings the offerings at the new moon and at all the appointed feasts of the LORD and the offerings of everyone who made a freewill offering to the LORD
From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the LORD But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not yet laid
So they gave money to the masons and the carpenters and food drink and oil to the Sidonians and the Tyrians to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea to Joppa according to the grant that they had from Cyrus king of Persia
Now in the second year after their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem in the second month Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak made a beginning together with the rest of their kinsmen the priests and the Levites and all who had come to Jerusalem from the captivity They appointed the Levites from twenty years old and upward to supervise the work of the house of the LORD
And Jeshua with his sons and his brothers and Kadmiel and his sons the sons of Judah together supervised the workmen in the house of God along with the sons of Henadad and the Levites their sons and brothers
And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD the priests in their vestments came forward with trumpets and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals to praise the LORD according to the directions of David king of Israel
And they sang responsively praising and giving thanks to the LORD For he is good for his steadfast love endures forever toward Israel And all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the LORD because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid
But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers houses old men who had seen the first house wept with a loud voice when they saw the foundation of this house being laid though many shouted aloud for joy
so that the people could not distinguish the sound of the joyful shout from the sound of the people s weeping for the people shouted with a great shout and the sound was heard far away
