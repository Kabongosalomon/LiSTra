Proverbs 21
The king s heart is a stream of water in the hand of the LORD he turns it wherever he will
Every way of a man is right in his own eyes but the LORD weighs the heart
To do righteousness and justice is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice
Haughty eyes and a proud heart the lamp of the wicked are sin
The plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance but everyone who is hasty comes only to poverty
The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor and a snare of death
The violence of the wicked will sweep them away because they refuse to do what is just
The way of the guilty is crooked but the conduct of the pure is upright
It is better to live in a corner of the housetop than in a house shared with a quarrelsome wife
The soul of the wicked desires evil his neighbor finds no mercy in his eyes
When a scoffer is punished the simple becomes wise when a wise man is instructed he gains knowledge
The Righteous One observes the house of the wicked he throws the wicked down to ruin
Whoever closes his ear to the cry of the poor will himself call out and not be answered
A gift in secret averts anger and a concealed bribe strong wrath
When justice is done it is a joy to the righteous but terror to evildoers
One who wanders from the way of good sense will rest in the assembly of the dead
Whoever loves pleasure will be a poor man he who loves wine and oil will not be rich
The wicked is a ransom for the righteous and the traitor for the upright
It is better to live in a desert land than with a quarrelsome and fretful woman
Precious treasure and oil are in a wise man s dwelling but a foolish man devours it
Whoever pursues righteousness and kindness will find life righteousness and honor
A wise man scales the city of the mighty and brings down the stronghold in which they trust
Whoever keeps his mouth and his tongue keeps himself out of trouble
Scoffer is the name of the arrogant haughty man who acts with arrogant pride
The desire of the sluggard kills him for his hands refuse to labor
All day long he craves and craves but the righteous gives and does not hold back
The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination how much more when he brings it with evil intent
A false witness will perish but the word of a man who hears will endure
A wicked man puts on a bold face but the upright gives thought to his ways
No wisdom no understanding no counsel can avail against the LORD
The horse is made ready for the day of battle but the victory belongs to the LORD
