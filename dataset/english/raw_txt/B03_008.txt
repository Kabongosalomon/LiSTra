Luke 8
Soon afterward he went on through cities and villages proclaiming and bringing the good news of the kingdom of God And the twelve were with him
and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities Mary called Magdalene from whom seven demons had gone out
and Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod s household manager and Susanna and many others who provided for them out of their means
And when a great crowd was gathering and people from town after town came to him he said in a parable
A sower went out to sow his seed And as he sowed some fell along the path and was trampled underfoot and the birds of the air devoured it
And some fell on the rock and as it grew up it withered away because it had no moisture
And some fell among thorns and the thorns grew up with it and choked it
And some fell into good soil and grew and yielded a hundredfold As he said these things he called out He who has ears to hear let him hear
And when his disciples asked him what this parable meant
he said To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God but for others they are in parables so that seeing they may not see and hearing they may not understand
Now the parable is this The seed is the word of God
The ones along the path are those who have heard then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts so that they may not believe and be saved
And the ones on the rock are those who when they hear the word receive it with joy But these have no root they believe for a while and in time of testing fall away
And as for what fell among the thorns they are those who hear but as they go on their way they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life and their fruit does not mature
As for that in the good soil they are those who hearing the word hold it fast in an honest and good heart and bear fruit with patience
No one after lighting a lamp covers it with a jar or puts it under a bed but puts it on a stand so that those who enter may see the light
For nothing is hidden that will not be made manifest nor is anything secret that will not be known and come to light
Take care then how you hear for to the one who has more will be given and from the one who has not even what he thinks that he has will be taken away
Then his mother and his brothers came to him but they could not reach him because of the crowd
And he was told Your mother and your brothers are standing outside desiring to see you
But he answered them My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it
One day he got into a boat with his disciples and he said to them Let us go across to the other side of the lake So they set out
and as they sailed he fell asleep And a windstorm came down on the lake and they were filling with water and were in danger
And they went and woke him saying Master Master we are perishing And he awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging waves and they ceased and there was a calm
He said to them Where is your faith And they were afraid and they marveled saying to one another Who then is this that he commands even winds and water and they obey him
Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes which is opposite Galilee
When Jesus had stepped out on land there met him a man from the city who had demons For a long time he had worn no clothes and he had not lived in a house but among the tombs
When he saw Jesus he cried out and fell down before him and said with a loud voice What have you to do with me Jesus Son of the Most High God I beg you do not torment me
For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man For many a time it had seized him He was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the desert
Jesus then asked him What is your name And he said Legion for many demons had entered him
And they begged him not to command them to depart into the abyss
Now a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside and they begged him to let them enter these So he gave them permission
Then the demons came out of the man and entered the pigs and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned
When the herdsmen saw what had happened they fled and told it in the city and in the country
Then people went out to see what had happened and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone sitting at the feet of Jesus clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid
And those who had seen it told them how the demon possessed man had been healed
Then all the people of the surrounding country of the Gerasenes asked him to depart from them for they were seized with great fear So he got into the boat and returned
The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him but Jesus sent him away saying
Return to your home and declare how much God has done for you And he went away proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him
Now when Jesus returned the crowd welcomed him for they were all waiting for him
And there came a man named Jairus who was a ruler of the synagogue And falling at Jesus feet he implored him to come to his house
for he had an only daughter about twelve years of age and she was dying As Jesus went the people pressed around him
And there was a woman who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years and though she had spent all her living on physicians she could not be healed by anyone
She came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment and immediately her discharge of blood ceased
And Jesus said Who was it that touched me When all denied it Peter said Master the crowds surround you and are pressing in on you
But Jesus said Someone touched me for I perceive that power has gone out from me
And when the woman saw that she was not hidden she came trembling and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him and how she had been immediately healed
And he said to her Daughter your faith has made you well go in peace
While he was still speaking someone from the ruler s house came and said Your daughter is dead do not trouble the Teacher any more
But Jesus on hearing this answered him Do not fear only believe and she will be well
And when he came to the house he allowed no one to enter with him except Peter and John and James and the father and mother of the child
And all were weeping and mourning for her but he said Do not weep for she is not dead but sleeping
And they laughed at him knowing that she was dead
But taking her by the hand he called saying Child arise
And her spirit returned and she got up at once And he directed that something should be given her to eat
And her parents were amazed but he charged them to tell no one what had happened
