John 14
Let not your hearts be troubled Believe in God believe also in me
In my Father s house are many rooms If it were not so would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you
And if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and will take you to myself that where I am you may be also
And you know the way to where I am going
Thomas said to him Lord we do not know where you are going How can we know the way
Jesus said to him I am the way and the truth and the life No one comes to the Father except through me
If you had known me you would have known my Father also From now on you do know him and have seen him
Philip said to him Lord show us the Father and it is enough for us
Jesus said to him Have I been with you so long and you still do not know me Philip Whoever has seen me has seen the Father How can you say Show us the Father
Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority but the Father who dwells in me does his works
Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me or else believe on account of the works themselves
Truly truly I say to you whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do and greater works than these will he do because I am going to the Father
Whatever you ask in my name this I will do that the Father may be glorified in the Son
If you ask me anything in my name I will do it
If you love me you will keep my commandments
And I will ask the Father and he will give you another Helper to be with you forever
even the Spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it neither sees him nor knows him You know him for he dwells with you and will be in you
I will not leave you as orphans I will come to you
Yet a little while and the world will see me no more but you will see me Because I live you also will live
In that day you will know that I am in my Father and you in me and I in you
Whoever has my commandments and keeps them he it is who loves me And he who loves me will be loved by my Father and I will love him and manifest myself to him
Judas not Iscariot said to him Lord how is it that you will manifest yourself to us and not to the world
Jesus answered him If anyone loves me he will keep my word and my Father will love him and we will come to him and make our home with him
Whoever does not love me does not keep my words And the word that you hear is not mine but the Father s who sent me
These things I have spoken to you while I am still with you
But the Helper the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in my name he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you
Peace I leave with you my peace I give to you Not as the world gives do I give to you Let not your hearts be troubled neither let them be afraid
You heard me say to you I am going away and I will come to you If you loved me you would have rejoiced because I am going to the Father for the Father is greater than I
And now I have told you before it takes place so that when it does take place you may believe
I will no longer talk much with you for the ruler of this world is coming He has no claim on me
but I do as the Father has commanded me so that the world may know that I love the Father Rise let us go from here
