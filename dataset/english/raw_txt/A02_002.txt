Exodus 2
Now a man from the house of Levi went and took as his wife a Levite woman
The woman conceived and bore a son and when she saw that he was a fine child she hid him three months
When she could hide him no longer she took for him a basket made of bulrushes and daubed it with bitumen and pitch She put the child in it and placed it among the reeds by the river bank
And his sister stood at a distance to know what would be done to him
Now the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river while her young women walked beside the river She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her servant woman and she took it
When she opened it she saw the child and behold the baby was crying She took pity on him and said This is one of the Hebrews children
Then his sister said to Pharaoh s daughter Shall I go and call you a nurse from the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you
And Pharaoh s daughter said to her Go So the girl went and called the child s mother
And Pharaoh s daughter said to her Take this child away and nurse him for me and I will give you your wages So the woman took the child and nursed him
When the child grew up she brought him to Pharaoh s daughter and he became her son She named him Moses Because she said I drew him out of the water
One day when Moses had grown up he went out to his people and looked on their burdens and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew one of his people
He looked this way and that and seeing no one he struck down the Egyptian and hid him in the sand
When he went out the next day behold two Hebrews were struggling together And he said to the man in the wrong Why do you strike your companion
He answered Who made you a prince and a judge over us Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian Then Moses was afraid and thought Surely the thing is known
When Pharaoh heard of it he sought to kill Moses But Moses fled from Pharaoh and stayed in the land of Midian And he sat down by a well
Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters and they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their father s flock
The shepherds came and drove them away but Moses stood up and saved them and watered their flock
When they came home to their father Reuel he said How is it that you have come home so soon today
They said An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds and even drew water for us and watered the flock
He said to his daughters Then where is he Why have you left the man Call him that he may eat bread
And Moses was content to dwell with the man and he gave Moses his daughter Zipporah
She gave birth to a son and he called his name Gershom for he said I have been a sojourner in a foreign land
During those many days the king of Egypt died and the people of Israel groaned because of their slavery and cried out for help Their cry for rescue from slavery came up to God
And God heard their groaning and God remembered his covenant with Abraham with Isaac and with Jacob
God saw the people of Israel and God knew
