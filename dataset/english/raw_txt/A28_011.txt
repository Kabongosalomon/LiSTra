Hosea 11
When Israel was a child I loved him and out of Egypt I called my son
The more they were called the more they went away they kept sacrificing to the Baals and burning offerings to idols
Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk I took them up by their arms but they did not know that I healed them
I led them with cords of kindness with the bands of love and I became to them as one who eases the yoke on their jaws and I bent down to them and fed them
They shall not return to the land of Egypt but Assyria shall be their king because they have refused to return to me
The sword shall rage against their cities consume the bars of their gates and devour them because of their own counsels
My people are bent on turning away from me and though they call out to the Most High he shall not raise them up at all
How can I give you up O Ephraim How can I hand you over O Israel How can I make you like Admah How can I treat you like Zeboiim My heart recoils within me my compassion grows warm and tender
I will not execute my burning anger I will not again destroy Ephraim for I am God and not a man the Holy One in your midst and I will not come in wrath
They shall go after the LORD he will roar like a lion when he roars his children shall come trembling from the west
they shall come trembling like birds from Egypt and like doves from the land of Assyria and I will return them to their homes declares the LORD
Ephraim has surrounded me with lies and the house of Israel with deceit but Judah still walks with God and is faithful to the Holy One
