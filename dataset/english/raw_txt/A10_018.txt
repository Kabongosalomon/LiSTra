2 Samuel 18
Then David mustered the men who were with him and set over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds
And David sent out the army one third under the command of Joab one third under the command of Abishai the son of Zeruiah Joab s brother and one third under the command of Ittai the Gittite And the king said to the men I myself will also go out with you
But the men said You shall not go out For if we flee they will not care about us If half of us die they will not care about us But you are worth ten thousand of us Therefore it is better that you send us help from the city
The king said to them Whatever seems best to you I will do So the king stood at the side of the gate while all the army marched out by hundreds and by thousands
And the king ordered Joab and Abishai and Ittai Deal gently for my sake with the young man Absalom And all the people heard when the king gave orders to all the commanders about Absalom
So the army went out into the field against Israel and the battle was fought in the forest of Ephraim
And the men of Israel were defeated there by the servants of David and the loss there was great on that day twenty thousand men
The battle spread over the face of all the country and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword
And Absalom happened to meet the servants of David Absalom was riding on his mule and the mule went under the thick branches of a great oak and his head caught fast in the oak and he was suspended between heaven and earth while the mule that was under him went on
And a certain man saw it and told Joab Behold I saw Absalom hanging in an oak
Joab said to the man who told him What you saw him Why then did you not strike him there to the ground I would have been glad to give you ten pieces of silver and a belt
But the man said to Joab Even if I felt in my hand the weight of a thousand pieces of silver I would not reach out my hand against the king s son for in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai For my sake protect the young man Absalom
On the other hand if I had dealt treacherously against his life and there is nothing hidden from the king then you yourself would have stood aloof
Joab said I will not waste time like this with you And he took three javelins in his hand and thrust them into the heart of Absalom while he was still alive in the oak
And ten young men Joab s armor bearers surrounded Absalom and struck him and killed him
Then Joab blew the trumpet and the troops came back from pursuing Israel for Joab restrained them
And they took Absalom and threw him into a great pit in the forest and raised over him a very great heap of stones And all Israel fled every one to his own home
Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up for himself the pillar that is in the King s Valley for he said I have no son to keep my name in remembrance He called the pillar after his own name and it is called Absalom s monument to this day
Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said Let me run and carry news to the king that the LORD has delivered him from the hand of his enemies
And Joab said to him You are not to carry news today You may carry news another day but today you shall carry no news because the king s son is dead
Then Joab said to the Cushite Go tell the king what you have seen The Cushite bowed before Joab and ran
Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said again to Joab Come what may let me also run after the Cushite And Joab said Why will you run my son seeing that you will have no reward for the news
Come what may he said I will run So he said to him Run Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain and outran the Cushite
Now David was sitting between the two gates and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate by the wall and when he lifted up his eyes and looked he saw a man running alone
The watchman called out and told the king And the king said If he is alone there is news in his mouth And he drew nearer and nearer
The watchman saw another man running And the watchman called to the gate and said See another man running alone The king said He also brings news
The watchman said I think the running of the first is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok And the king said He is a good man and comes with good news
Then Ahimaaz cried out to the king All is well And he bowed before the king with his face to the earth and said Blessed be the LORD your God who has delivered up the men who raised their hand against my lord the king
And the king said Is it well with the young man Absalom Ahimaaz answered When Joab sent the king s servant your servant I saw a great commotion but I do not know what it was
And the king said Turn aside and stand here So he turned aside and stood still
And behold the Cushite came and the Cushite said Good news for my lord the king For the LORD has delivered you this day from the hand of all who rose up against you
The king said to the Cushite Is it well with the young man Absalom And the Cushite answered May the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise up against you for evil be like that young man
And the king was deeply moved and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept And as he went he said O my son Absalom my son my son Absalom Would I had died instead of you O Absalom my son my son
