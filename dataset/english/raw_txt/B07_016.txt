1 Corienthians 16
Now concerning the collection for the saints as I directed the churches of Galatia so you also are to do
On the first day of every week each of you is to put something aside and store it up as he may prosper so that there will be no collecting when I come
And when I arrive I will send those whom you accredit by letter to carry your gift to Jerusalem
If it seems advisable that I should go also they will accompany me
I will visit you after passing through Macedonia for I intend to pass through Macedonia
and perhaps I will stay with you or even spend the winter so that you may help me on my journey wherever I go
For I do not want to see you now just in passing I hope to spend some time with you if the Lord permits
But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost
for a wide door for effective work has opened to me and there are many adversaries
When Timothy comes see that you put him at ease among you for he is doing the work of the Lord as I am
So let no one despise him Help him on his way in peace that he may return to me for I am expecting him with the brothers
Now concerning our brother Apollos I strongly urged him to visit you with the other brothers but it was not at all his will to come now He will come when he has opportunity
Be watchful stand firm in the faith act like men be strong
Let all that you do be done in love
Now I urge you brothers you know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia and that they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints
be subject to such as these and to every fellow worker and laborer
I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus because they have made up for your absence
for they refreshed my spirit as well as yours Give recognition to such men
The churches of Asia send you greetings Aquila and Prisca together with the church in their house send you hearty greetings in the Lord
All the brothers send you greetings Greet one another with a holy kiss
I Paul write this greeting with my own hand
If anyone has no love for the Lord let him be accursed Our Lord come
The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you
My love be with you all in Christ Jesus Amen
