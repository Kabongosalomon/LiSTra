Luke 18
And he told them a parable to the effect that they ought always to pray and not lose heart
He said In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected man
And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying Give me justice against my adversary
For a while he refused but afterward he said to himself Though I neither fear God nor respect man
yet because this widow keeps bothering me I will give her justice so that she will not beat me down by her continual coming
And the Lord said Hear what the unrighteous judge says
And will not God give justice to his elect who cry to him day and night Will he delay long over them
I tell you he will give justice to them speedily Nevertheless when the Son of Man comes will he find faith on earth
He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and treated others with contempt
Two men went up into the temple to pray one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector
The Pharisee standing by himself prayed thus God I thank you that I am not like other men extortioners unjust adulterers or even like this tax collector
I fast twice a week I give tithes of all that I get
But the tax collector standing far off would not even lift up his eyes to heaven but beat his breast saying God be merciful to me a sinner
I tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled but the one who humbles himself will be exalted
Now they were bringing even infants to him that he might touch them And when the disciples saw it they rebuked them
But Jesus called them to him saying Let the children come to me and do not hinder them for to such belongs the kingdom of God
Truly I say to you whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it
And a ruler asked him Good Teacher what must I do to inherit eternal life
And Jesus said to him Why do you call me good No one is good except God alone
You know the commandments Do not commit adultery Do not murder Do not steal Do not bear false witness Honor your father and mother
And he said All these I have kept from my youth
When Jesus heard this he said to him One thing you still lack Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven and come follow me
But when he heard these things he became very sad for he was extremely rich
Jesus seeing that he had become sad said How difficult it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God
For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God
Those who heard it said Then who can be saved
But he said What is impossible with men is possible with God
And Peter said See we have left our homes and followed you
And he said to them Truly I say to you there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God
who will not receive many times more in this time and in the age to come eternal life
And taking the twelve he said to them See we are going up to Jerusalem and everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished
For he will be delivered over to the Gentiles and will be mocked and shamefully treated and spit upon
And after flogging him they will kill him and on the third day he will rise
But they understood none of these things This saying was hidden from them and they did not grasp what was said
As he drew near to Jericho a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging
And hearing a crowd going by he inquired what this meant
They told him Jesus of Nazareth is passing by
And he cried out Jesus Son of David have mercy on me
And those who were in front rebuked him telling him to be silent But he cried out all the more Son of David have mercy on me
And Jesus stopped and commanded him to be brought to him And when he came near he asked him
What do you want me to do for you He said Lord let me recover my sight
And Jesus said to him Recover your sight your faith has made you well
And immediately he recovered his sight and followed him glorifying God And all the people when they saw it gave praise to God
